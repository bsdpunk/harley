Dealer installation is recommended and special tools are required for proper installation. SCREAMIN' EAGLE Twin Cam Stage II Upgrade A. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE 2 WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP A great upgrade for any performance motor. The Billet Cam Support Plate is manufactured from billet aluminum with pressed-in bronze bushings and is pre-assembled with the crankshaft bushing and oil pressure relief valve. Aluminum is specified at 6061 billet plate, heat-treated to T6 specifications with a surface-hardened anodized finish to provide superior strength, rigidity and durability. CNC-precision machining ensures precise dimensions and constant material thickness across the plate, enabling perfect alignment of cams and chains. Cam bushings are made from 660 bronze materials to provide enhanced wear resistance and to stand up to increased loads from the high lift cams common in large displacement motors. The improved Screamin' Eagle highflow oil pump provides higher pressure when the oil is hot to keep pressure drops to a minimum and increases the oil supply by 16% and the scavenging by 29% over the '06-'17 Original Equipment oil pump.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT This kit updates the cam chain tensioner of your Twin Cam 88 engine to the latest design, as featured on the Twin Cam 96TM engine. The billet cam support plate has been designed to allow the installation of the Twin Cam 96 hydraulic cam chain tensioner to Twin Cam 88-equipped models. These Hydraulic Cam Chain Tensioners will significantly outlast the spring loaded tensioners and are an ideal addition to an engine modified for improved performance. In addition, '02-'06 models utilize a Twin Cam 96 single row front roller chain and sprocket (included in kit). '99-'01 models use Original Equipment front silent chain and sprocket to retain the cam position sensor function. The kit includes an improved Screamin' Eagle HighFlow Oil Pump that provides increased oil pressure at highoperating temperatures. This kit increases the oil supply by 23% and scavenging by 50% when compared to the '99-'05 Original Equipment oil pump and reduces operating temperature of bearings to improve bearing life.", "Harley Davidson", "" , , "", "Title", "Default Title", , , , , "17045-99", ,,,,,"365.46","429.95"
