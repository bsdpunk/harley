That's where we developed and tested the revolutionary comfort of the Road Zeppelin Seat. This remarkable seat removes pressure points and hot spots by adjusting the amount of air contained in each bladder within the seat. Easyto-reach rocker switches on the side of the seat control the built-in compressor, adding and bleeding off air with the quick push of a button to help relieve stress from the lower back, tailbone or lower extremities. On a long run, occasionally inflating and deflating the air bladders reduces the numb butt effect by improving the blood flow to the extremities. So grab a seat. And enjoy the ride. A. ROAD ZEPPELIN AIR ADJUSTABLE SEAT The Road Zeppelin seat's ergonomically-friendly design combines a narrow front nose for ease of touching the ground at a stop with a wide seating surface for long range rider and passenger comfort.
