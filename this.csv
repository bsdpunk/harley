screamin'-eagle-hydraulic-2-cam-chain-tensioner-and-high-flow-oil-pump-upgrade-kit-17045-99D, SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT  , SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE 2 WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP A great upgrade for any performance motor. The Billet Cam Support Plate is manufactured from billet aluminum with pressed-in bronze bushings and is pre-assembled with the crankshaft bushing and oil pressure relief valve. Aluminum is specified at 6061 billet plate heat-treated to T6 specifications with a surface-hardened anodized finish to provide superior strength rigidity and durability. CNC-precision machining ensures precise dimensions and constant material thickness across the plate enabling perfect alignment of cams and chains. Cam bushings are made from 660 bronze materials to provide enhanced wear resistance and to stand up to increased loads from the high lift cams common in large displacement motors. The improved Screamin' Eagle highflow oil pump provides higher pressure when the oil is hot to keep pressure drops to a minimum and increases the oil supply by 16% and the scavenging by 29% over the '06-'17 Original Equipment oil pump. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT This kit updates the cam chain tensioner of your Twin Cam 88 engine to the latest design as featured on the Twin Cam 96TM engine. The billet cam support plate has been designed to allow the installation of the Twin Cam 96 hydraulic cam chain tensioner to Twin Cam 88-equipped models. These Hydraulic Cam Chain Tensioners will significantly outlast the spring loaded tensioners and are an ideal addition to an engine modified for improved performance. In addition '02-'06 models utilize a Twin Cam 96 single row front roller chain and sprocket (included in kit). '99-'01 models use Original Equipment front silent chain and sprocket to retain the cam position sensor function. The kit includes an improved Screamin' Eagle HighFlow Oil Pump that provides increased oil pressure at highoperating temperatures. This kit increases the oil supply by 23% and scavenging by 50% when compared to the '99-'05 Original Equipment oil pump and reduces operating temperature of bearings to improve bearing life., Harley Davidson,  , , , Title, Default Title, , , , , 17045-99D, ,,,,,365.46,429.95

SCREAMIN' EAGLE SE8-447 CAM TORQUE Enhanced torque in the low to mid RPM band Ideal for a fully-loaded bike Increased horsepower in the mid RPM range Responds well to roll-on throttle application Crisp throttle response and acceleration at lower speeds Can be used with stock valve springs SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 STAGE II TORQUE KIT This kit was developed for the budget minded rider that wants to experience crisp throttle response and acceleration they can feel at slower speeds. The 5% increase in torque can be felt immediately off the line and continues to build by up to a 14% increase @ 4500 RPM the ideal power band for passing slow moving vehicles. SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 STAGE II POWER KIT This kit was developed for the budget minded rider that wants to experience that adrenaline-pumping burst of speed while heading toward the red line. The additional power starts to build @ 3000 RPM and continues to build by up to 24% at redline. Riding the bike aggressively will require downshifting to lower gears to keep the engine operating in the higher RPM range. SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 ENGINE STAGE III KIT This kit was developed for the rider looking for a solid seat of the pants increase you can feel every time you roll on the throttle. The increase in displacement and the bump in compression deliver a significant increase in torque and power over stock while restoring the sensation of riding solo when taking that long trip with a passenger and luggage. The Stage III 107 to 114 upgrade delivers up to 39% more power and the 114 to 117 upgrade increases power by up to 24% when compared to the Original Equipment engine configurations. The increased compression and cam upgrade will also deliver 17% improvement over a stock CVO117 configuration. SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 ENGINE STAGE IV KIT This Stage IV Kit was developed to deliver maximum horsepower from the Milwaukee-Eight engine - all the way to the redline. The system-matched combination of larger displacement cylinders free flowing CNC-Ported cylinder heads and a cam with the highest available valve lift are the starting point to building the perfect engine for the performance junkie. The addition of the large 64mm bore throttle body and high-flow injectors provides great acceleration from first gear through sixth and exceptional response at the twist of the throttle. Designed for a high level of flexibility this package is ideal for riders who want stump pulling torque throughout the RPM range and also crave plenty of arm-pulling acceleration when you whack the throttle. The Stage IV 107 to 114 upgrade delivers up to 52% more power and the 114 to 117 upgrade increases power by up to 40% when compared to the Original Equipment engine configurations. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE 2 WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP A great upgrade for any performance motor. The Billet Cam Support Plate is manufactured from billet aluminum with pressed-in bronze bushings and is pre-assembled with the crankshaft bushing and oil pressure relief valve. Aluminum is specified at 6061 billet plate heat-treated to T6 specifications with a surface-hardened anodized finish to provide superior strength rigidity and durability. CNC-precision machining ensures precise dimensions and constant material thickness across the plate enabling perfect alignment of cams and chains. Cam bushings are made from 660 bronze materials to provide enhanced wear resistance and to stand up to increased loads from the high lift cams common in large displacement motors. The improved Screamin' Eagle highflow oil pump provides higher pressure when the oil is hot to keep pressure drops to a minimum and increases the oil supply by 16% and the scavenging by 29% over the '06-'17 Original Equipment oil pump. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT This kit updates the cam chain tensioner of your Twin Cam 88 engine to the latest design as featured on the Twin Cam 96TM engine. The billet cam support plate has been designed to allow the installation of the Twin Cam 96 hydraulic cam chain tensioner to Twin Cam 88-equipped models. These Hydraulic Cam Chain Tensioners will significantly outlast the spring loaded tensioners and are an ideal addition to an engine modified for improved performance. In addition '02-'06 models utilize a Twin Cam 96 single row front roller chain and sprocket (included in kit). '99-'01 models use Original Equipment front silent chain and sprocket to retain the cam position sensor function. The kit includes an improved Screamin' Eagle HighFlow Oil Pump that provides increased oil pressure at highoperating temperatures. This kit increases the oil supply by 23% and scavenging by 50% when compared to the '99-'05 Original Equipment oil pump and reduces operating temperature of bearings to improve bearing life., Harley Davidson,  , , , Title, Default Title, , , , , 25566-06, ,,,,,161.46,189.95

The shift ring system is similar to the system used in the VRSCTM transmission and it slides on the shafts to mate into the gears. This eliminates sliding heavy gears to accomplish the shift and results in smooth precise and light effort shifting. Sixth gear is a true overdrive at a .89:1 ratio and the first five gears mimic today's proven 5-speed ratios. The overdrive feature allows you to run a lower engine RPM in sixth gear at any given road speed. Lower RPM can result in lower vibration longer engine life and smoother cruising.

The surface area is increased by 13% and the spring rate is increased by 10% for a combination that can handle over 115 ft-lbs of torque at the crank a 23% increase over the stock-rated capacity. Kit includes Kevlar fiber-based friction discs and performance clutch spring. SCREAMIN' EAGLE PERFORMANCE 2 SLIPPER CLUTCH FOR VRSCTM MODELS This clutch offers reduced lever effort and improved performance. The unique slip and assist ramp system opens the two halves of the clutch hub slightly during high loads to the drivetrain allowing a moderate slip that reduces shock to the drivetrain during rapid downshifting. The resulting reduction in wheel hop allows maximum contact between the tire and the road in wet or slippery conditions. Clutch lever effort is also reduced by 20% in 1130cc and 30% on 1250cc applications., Harley Davidson,  , , , Title, Default Title, , , , , 37938-08K, ,,,,,203.96,239.95

Designed to outperform the Original Equipment compensator this unit helps protect the engine and driveline components during harsh drag race launches. Compensator features improved oil passages oil deflectors and a needle bearing thrust washer that improves the overall operation of these components. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BIG TWIN COMPENSATOR SCREAMIN' EAGLE VARIABLE PRESSURE CLUTCH 2 Get more performance from the Original Equipment clutch. The Screamin' Eagle Variable Pressure Clutch is designed to help put the added power from a Screamin' Eagle Stage Kit to the pavement. This bolt-on kit harnesses the centrifugal force of spinning weights to increase the clutch capacity as engine speed increases. The mechanism applies increasing pressure to the stock clutch pressure plate as RPM rises. The result: High torque-handling capabilities without increasing clutch lever effort at idle. The Variable Pressure Clutch also provides smoother clutch disengagement at lower speed. Kit fits behind most stock derby covers with no modifications.

passenger-footpeg-mount-kit-a-50932-08, PASSENGER FOOTPEG MOUNT KIT A , REACH SEAT REACH SEAT BLACKLINETM & SOFTAIL SLIM The Reach forward position seat is designed to move riders 1.25 closer to the hand and foot controls. The scooped bucket-shape saddle provides a wide seating surface and added back support for long-range touring while the narrow tapered front profile brings your legs 1.0 closer together to help your feet rest firmly on the pavement when stopped. The correct riding position can help a tall rider sit comfortably on the bike and avoid leg cramps and back strain during a long day in the saddle. For riders with a longer inseam a Tallboy Seat will put you on the road to fatigue-free riding. Designed to move the rider up and back from the stock seating position a Tallboy Seat can eliminate the knees-high riding position and effectively places the body for a natural arm and leg reach to the controls. Tallboy Seats feature a bucket-shaped design for added support and a wide seating surface to reduce pressure on the tailbone. This Tallboy Seat moves the rider back 2.0 and up 3.0 as compared to the Original Equipment seat. The new position allows additional leg and arm movement for the long-limbed rider and a comfortable seating space for the open road. The Tallboy Seat features a smooth vinyl surface that complements many motorcycle models and a wide pillion for added passenger comfort.

The top-grain leather seating surface and contoured foam padding provide a firm but luxurious feel. Seat does not fit with passenger pillions.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE FULLY ADJUSTABLE PIGGYBACK SHOCKS PERFORMANCE SUSPENSION KIT XR1200 Maximize the canyon-carving ability of your XR1200 motorcycle with this complete Performance Suspension Kit. Fullyadjustable light-weight suspension system features Showa's new Big Piston Front fork (BPF) design. The BPF eliminates many of the internal components used in a cartridge-type fork simplifying construction and resulting in lighter overall fork weight. The large-diameter of the BPF's internal piston allows a reduction in damping pressure for better feedback and smoother action. This performance suspension kit also provides a very controlled feeling which leads to more rider confidence. The BPF's rebound and compression damping force settings are easily fine-tuned via two adjuster screws located on top of the fork bolts. The spring pre-load is adjusted via a M5 hex screw on the axle holders. The rear Showa shocks feature 36mm pistons with piggyback nitrogen-charged reservoirs. The compression damping can be adjusted via a knob on top of the piggyback reservoir. The rebound is adjusted with a thumb wheel on the lower clevis. Rear spring pre-load is also adjustable on the shock for optimum 1G sag.

premium-ride-emulsion-shock-54619-08, PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCK , PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT* This Single Sided Cartridge Fork provides improved handling performance by keeping the tire in contact with the road surface. Tuned to work in concert with the Premium Emulsion Rear Shocks the fork damping is controlled by a specifically calibrated piston and valve stack. Unlike typical orifice damping the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop. A perfect addition during the installation of chrome or gloss black lower fork sliders the kit includes fork pipe cartridge fork bolts main springs and oil seals. PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCKS* Experience a comfortable and confidence-inspiring ride no matter the pavement conditions with Harley-Davidson Premium Ride Emulsion Shocks. These fast acting monotube nitrogen gas-charged shocks offer enhanced compression and rebound damping control when compared to typical twin-tube shock absorbers. The nitrogen gas charged shocks resist oil aeration and work with the internal valve stack to provide superior damping control in the twisties. The large 36mm pistons and low viscosity high-performance oil allow these shocks to react quickly to impacts and keep the tires tracking the road surface. You get a controlled ride and minimized bottoming harshness transmitted through the frame. The locking threaded adjustment lets you fine tune the spring preload to your current riding conditions whether a solo run on the back roads or a fully-loaded two-up freeway tour and urethane bumpers provide a softer feel if the shock bottoms under load. The beautifully-finished shocks feature black-anodized billet top caps and black progressively-wound springs. Kit includes left and right shock and preload adjustment spanner wrench. 54000066 Stock Height. $599.95 Fits '06-'17 Dyna models (except FLD and '07-'08 FXDSE). Original Equipment on FXDLS models. C.

premium-ride-single-cartridge-fork-kit*-54704-07, PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT*  , PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT* This Single Sided Cartridge Fork provides improved handling performance by keeping the tire in contact with the road surface. Tuned to work in concert with the Premium Emulsion Rear Shocks the fork damping is controlled by a specifically calibrated piston and valve stack. Unlike typical orifice damping the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop. A perfect addition during the installation of chrome or gloss black lower fork sliders the kit includes fork pipe cartridge fork bolts main springs and oil seals. 45400091 Standard Height. $349.95 Fits '04-'15 XL883 XL883C XL883R XL1200R and XL1200V and '04-'10 XL1200C models. 45400090 Low-Profile. $349.95 A.

PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCKS* Experience a comfortable and confidence-inspiring ride no matter the pavement conditions with Harley-Davidson Premium Ride Emulsion Shocks. These fast shocks offer enhanced compression and rebound damping control when compared to typical twin-tube shock absorbers. The nitrogen gas charged shocks resist oil aeration and work with the internal valve stack to provide superior damping control in the twisties. The large pistons and low viscosity high-performance oil allow these shocks to react quickly to impacts and keep the tires tracking the road surface. With the addition of urethane bumpers you get a controlled ride and minimized bottoming harshness. The locking threaded adjustment lets you fine tune the spring preload to your current riding conditions whether a solo run on the back roads or a fully-loaded two-up freeway tour. Kit includes left and right shock and preload adjustment spanner wrench. 54000076 Standard Height. $599.95 Fits '04-'15 XL models (except XL883C XL1200T '11-'15 XL883L '04-'11 XL1200C and '06-'07 XL1200L). 54000077 Low-Profile. $599.95 Fits '04-'15 XL models (except XL883 XL883R XL1200R and XL1200T).

premium-ride-emulsion-shock-60633-08, PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCK , PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT* This Single Sided Cartridge Fork provides improved handling performance by keeping the tire in contact with the road surface. Tuned to work in concert with the Premium Emulsion Rear Shocks the fork damping is controlled by a specifically calibrated piston and valve stack. Unlike typical orifice damping the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop. A perfect addition during the installation of chrome or gloss black lower fork sliders the kit includes fork pipe cartridge fork bolts main springs and oil seals. PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCKS* Experience a comfortable and confidence-inspiring ride no matter the pavement conditions with Harley-Davidson Premium Ride Emulsion Shocks. These fast acting monotube nitrogen gas-charged shocks offer enhanced compression and rebound damping control when compared to typical twin-tube shock absorbers. The nitrogen gas charged shocks resist oil aeration and work with the internal valve stack to provide superior damping control in the twisties. The large 36mm pistons and low viscosity high-performance oil allow these shocks to react quickly to impacts and keep the tires tracking the road surface. You get a controlled ride and minimized bottoming harshness transmitted through the frame. The locking threaded adjustment lets you fine tune the spring preload to your current riding conditions whether a solo run on the back roads or a fully-loaded two-up freeway tour and urethane bumpers provide a softer feel if the shock bottoms under load. The beautifully-finished shocks feature black-anodized billet top caps and black progressively-wound springs. Kit includes left and right shock and preload adjustment spanner wrench. 54000066 Stock Height. $599.95 Fits '06-'17 Dyna models (except FLD and '07-'08 FXDSE). Original Equipment on FXDLS models. C. PREMIUM PROFILE LOW REAR SUSPENSION KIT* Introduced on the '08 FXDF model these custom rear shocks lower your bike while they raise the level of style. These lowprofile shocks lower the seat height by approximately 1.0. The rear shock and spring is completely covered with mirrorpolished and chrome-plated sleeves for a sleek beefy look.

This performance suspension kit also provides a very controlled feeling which leads to more rider confidence. The BPF's rebound and compression damping force settings are easily fine-tuned via two adjuster screws located on top of the fork bolts. The spring pre-load is adjusted via a M5 hex screw on the axle holders. The rear Showa shocks feature 36mm pistons with piggyback nitrogen-charged reservoirs. The compression damping can be adjusted via a knob on top of the piggyback reservoir. The rebound is adjusted with a thumb wheel on the lower clevis. Rear spring pre-load is also adjustable on the shock for optimum 1G sag.
