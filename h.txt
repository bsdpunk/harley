all for freedom.

FREEDOM FOR ALL.
It's not just a machine -- it's the freedom to express exactly who you are. Whether it's head-to-tail chrome or blacked out and sinister, there's nothing like having your Harley-Davidson® motorcycle exactly the way you want it. Every nuance of your ride -- from how you feel in the saddle to how it looks parked under a streetlight in front of your favorite hangout -- is for you and you alone to decide. And it all starts right here. From the company that practically invented freedom come thousands of parts and accessories, each designed to accomplish one simple task: to make your Harley-Davidson® motorcycle yours.

You didn't settle when you chose the bike. So why go for second best when it's time for parts? To create a truly unique declaration of your own personality and attitude, you need the parts to perform up to Harley-Davidson standards: exceptional styling, durability and finish. We engineer our parts to your bike's Original Equipment specifications and torture them in the lab and on the test track to ensure fit, function and durability. All this, along with corrosion and vibration testing, gives you the satisfaction and security you need to take on all of life's adventures. And we back it up with a two-year warranty on accessories installed within 60 days of vehicle purchase. After all, the Harley-Davidson reputation rides on the quality of our parts.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | GENUINE PARTS + ACCESSORIES

the tank says "harley-davidson."

EVERyTHING ELSE SAYS YOU.
No two riders' bikes are the same. That's why Harley-Davidson offers thousands of parts and accessories to let you make your bike as one of a kind as you are.

COMFORT
The better your bike fits, the more time you'll want to spend chasing that yellow line. When you personalize the bike with a seat, a handlebar, foot controls and ride height that's just right, you and your passenger will be comfortable mile after mile.

FUNCTION
For a quick commute or a trip across the country, a windshield, a luggage rack, a passenger backrest and saddlebags all help you get the most out of your ride.

STYLE
Don't just make a statement -- ride one. Chrome or black. Traditional or contemporary. New school or old school. Pick your direction and Harley-Davidson can deliver the options that make it yours.

PERFORMANCE
With Screamin' Eagle® Performance Parts, you can take the performance of your bike to the next level. From intake and exhaust to big bore kits and premium suspension, Harley-Davidson delivers the adrenaline rush you crave.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | COMFORT

true to form
On the road, you've got to feel good in the saddle. When you swing your leg over and your foot taps the ground on the other side, the bike welcomes you like an old friend. When your hands and feet fall naturally to the controls, you feel in command. Whether you're cruising around town or out for a long run, your bike should feel like an extension of yourself.

TAKE CONTROL
Control on the road is paramount for the rider. Sitting comfortably, grasping the handlebar firmly and placing your feet on the ground with confidence all result in a controlled and comfortable ride.

FOR THE SHORTER RIDER
B A A

THE SWEET SIGH OF RELIEF
The correct riding position can help a rider sit comfortably on the bike and avoid leg cramps and back strain during a long day in the saddle. Selecting the proper seat height, handlebar and foot controls will put you on the road to a nearly effortless riding experience.

C B

A COMFORT UP FOR GRABS Selecting the right handlebar is critical for a rider with short arms. The width, rise and pullback of the handlebars should allow the hands to lie naturally on the bars without pulling the rider forward on the seat when turning.

FOR THE TALLER RIDER
A SELECTING THE RIGHT SEAT For riders with longer inseams, consider testing a Tallboy® seat. It's designed to move the rider up and back from the stock seating position to avoid a "knees-high" leg position. B COMFORT WITHIN REACH The position of your hands, wrists and elbows directly affects how you feel on the bike. A Tallboy® handlebar moves the controls away from the rider for a natural arm stretch. C STRETCH FOR THE LONG HAUL Extended-reach footboards, a folding heel shift lever, and a Mustache Engine Guard or highway pegs provide freedom to stretch and change position while riding.

B POSITION OF POWER Designed to move riders with a shorter inseam closer to the controls, the Reach® Seat also features a lower profile and a narrow thigh zone to bring the legs closer together to minimize leg stretch.

RIDING POSITIONS

C
5'5" rider with 30" inseam shown

PROFILING High-style, boulevard-bound posture that's achieved with a pulled-back or an ape hanger type handlebar, forward foot position, and solo or low profile seat.

CRUISING The ultimate fusion of comfort and laidback style that's achieved with a tall pulled-back handlebar, a deep seat and a mid-range foot position.

SPORT Upright stance with emphasis on handling that's achieved with flat handlebars and a mid-range or slightly mid-range foot position.

TOURING Natural, upright position for high-mile comfort that's achieved with a wide handlebar, a standard foot position with pegs or footboards, and a deep bucket seat.

C LOWERING THE SUSPENSION Adjusting the ride height by lowering the suspension generates a lower center of gravity, increasing control for the shorter rider. Combined with a narrow-width seat, the feet remain firmly planted at a stop.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | FUNCTION

choose your tools
Cruising, chasing the horizon or a little of both? Harley-Davidson has a wide range of saddlebags, luggage racks, Tour-Pak® carriers, backrests and other functional items that will come in handy out on the open road. Consider your riding style when choosing functional accessories, and if it's versatility you crave, check out some of the detachable accessories below.
A

EQUIPPED FOR THE ROAD
Geared up with the right accessories, this long-haul motorcycle is ready to tackle the miles. Comfort-driven accessories, such as windshields and backrests, ease the physical strain of life on the road and make for a less stressful ride. Visit your Harley-Davidson® dealer for more details on finding your perfect fit.

A WINDSHIELDS Nobody likes getting abused by a head wind. Adding a detachable windshield will take the wind off your chest and arms and keep you out on the road longer.

B

B PASSENGER BACKRESTS With a detachable backrest, your bike can go from a stripped-down afternoon cruiser to a two-up touring machine in seconds. Your passenger will thank you.

D

LOAD UP
Depending on the ride you've got planned, your storage needs will vary. Efficient, versatile luggage systems provide you with the storage space for a longer ride. Pack your rainsuit, riding gear, tools, tent and sleeping bag. You'll still have room for the T-shirts you buy along the way.
C SADDLEBAGS Saddlebags provide ample storage and carry the weight low on the bike for a comfortable riding balance. Detachable leather bags allow you to strip the bike down when you arrive.

STRIPPED FOR THE STREET
C

D LUGGAGE RACKS AND SOFT LUGGAGE

Designed for maximum versatility, soft touring bags accommodate a lot of gear. The bags easily strap to a luggage rack and offer grab-and-go convenience once you've reached your destination.

Designed to be installed or removed in seconds, detachable accessories give you the flexibility to outfit your bike for the day's ride. Pop off the windshield, backrest and saddlebags and you're ready for a night on the town.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | STYLE

put your signature on ours
This is where your motorcycle comes to life. Machinery can only take you so far -- it's up to your unrelenting passion to make the bike into a symbol of your individuality. Style isn't dictated by the masses -- it's something that comes from your soul. Old school, new school or no school -- find a direction, take a stance and execute accordingly. Exact same bike, entirely different style. Whether you're looking for a stripped-down, dark-as-night look or a complete chrome makeover, these unique takes on the 2018 Breakout® model will give you exactly what you need and nothing you don't.

DARK AS NIGHT
Strip it down and black it out. This twisted take on custom keeps the minimalist roots of motorcycling alive. Black hand controls and fork sliders set the tone up front, while the flat drag-style handlebar, gloss-black engine covers and black ceramic-coated Screamin' Eagle® mufflers bring a little unrest to the streets.

BRIGHT AS DAY
When it's layered in chrome and custom paint, double-takes come with the territory and gawking crowds get old...almost. Start at the beginning with chrome front forks and a high-rise ape handlebar. Then draw the eye to the rear with custom foot controls, engine covers and Screamin' Eagle® exhaust. Chrome is classic for a reason.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | PERFORMANCE

screamin' eagle performance
Start quick. Turn tight. Stop fast. Repeat. Screamin' Eagle® Performance Parts and Accessories are engineered with absolute precision and designed to amp up the performance of your powertrain, suspension and exhaust. We make these upgrades work together to boost output without compromising reliability or ridability. It's our goal to make sure riders get everything needed to turn a stock bike into a heart-pounding, pavement-melting, one-of-a-kind freedom machine.

®

PURE SOUND
The sound of a Harley-Davidson® motorcycle grabs the heart and moves the soul. The complete line of Screamin' Eagle® Performance Mufflers are tuned to enhance the bass notes and deliver a rich melodic tone from idle to wide-open throttle. When compared to stock bikes, these stylish slip-on mufflers produce real-world performance improvement, while maintaining compliant sound levels.

MORE POWER
Your V-Twin engine has so much more to give. You just have to know where to find it. From a little more torque (when compared to stock bikes) to gobs of hang-on-tight horsepower, Screamin' Eagle® Performance Parts and Accessories can help you get everything you ever wanted out of your Harley-Davidson® powerplant. Available as single parts or all-in-one stage kits, Screamin' Eagle® components are ready to take the performance of your engine to new heights.

GREAT RIDE
Whether you're fine-tuning for cargo and passengers or looking to carry more speed through the twisties, an upgraded Screamin' Eagle® suspension allows you to get maximum comfort and handling out of your ride.

Windshields & LED Headlamps

A. QUICK-RELEASE SUPER SPORT WINDSHIELD Reduces the pounding of wind and shower of bugs but keeps the wind-in-the-hair feeling. Ideal for a cool morning ride, the sleek profile of the Super Sport Windshield hugs the front headlamp for a sporty look. The windshield mounts to the fork tubes with elegant die-cast lever locking clamps, so the windshield does not require any "leave-behind" docking hardware. You get quick on-and-off convenience and a clean, custom look. No tools are required and the kit includes everything needed to install the windshield.
57400192 Light Smoke. $319.95 Fits '15-later XG models (except XG750A). Installation requires removal of Original Equipment headlamp visor. Models equipped with a front mounted license plate require separate purchase of License Plate Bracket P/N 67900227. Windshield dimensions: Overall height 25.0"; width ­ 20.1".

B. DAYMAKERTM LED HEADLAMPS Cut through the night. Harley-Davidson ® LED Lamps are brighter and whiter in color and provide a superior light pattern over standard incandescent lamps. Compared to the yellow light of a traditional halogen bulb, the LED lamp produces a "Daylight Color Impression" that appears more natural to the user. Headlamps feature horizontal "D-shaped" lenses that focus light into a pool in front of the motorcycle and separate high beam and low beam projector lenses that provide a focused beam of light ahead. Lamps are available in your choice of brilliant chrome or gloss black background to match your styling direction. The solid-state LEDs are designed for long life and the shock- and vibration-resistant lamp assembly mounts into existing light housings. Installation is quick and easy and the plug-in lamps connect to the factory headlamp wiring. The LED lamps are DOT and ECE compliant.
Fits '15-later XG models.

Seating
C. CAFÉ SOLO SEAT There's something about the placement of the rider that makes the Cafe Solo Seat special. The one-up design and the high back pad hold the rider in place and provide a direct connection to the bike. You sit "in" the bike and your hands and feet reach naturally to the controls. The low-slung pad, narrow nose and the tapered tail enhance the bike's sporting profile and pays homage to the heritage of the iconic Café Racer style.

D. REACH® SEAT Designed specifically for riders requiring a close to the bar riding position, this Reach® Seat is shaped to place the rider in a comfortable and confident relationship to the hand and foot controls. The seat moves the rider approximately 1.5" lower and 1.25" forward and the 1.25" slimmer front profile brings the legs closer together for an easier reach to the ground at a stop. The Reach Seat features a stepped profile that keeps the rider from sliding back during acceleration.

C. CAFÉ SOLO SEAT E. TALLBOY® SEAT The correct riding position can help a tall rider sit comfortably on the bike, and avoid leg cramps and back strain during a long day in the saddle. For riders with a longer inseam, a Tallboy® Seat will put you on the road to fatigue-free riding. Designed to move the rider 1.25" up and 2.5" back from the stock seating position, a Tallboy Seat can eliminate the "knees-high" riding position and effectively places the body for a natural arm and leg reach to the controls.

It's like something that just rolled out of a back-alley workshop: fat-tired, high handlebars, slab-sided styling. The asymmetric 115th Anniversary eagle spreads over the Anniversary Legend Blue Denim peanut tank, and the minimal Vivid Black fenders are the perfect touch against the chunky rubber.

COMFORT

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | SPORTSTER® COMFORT

COMFORT IS KEY Bikes are a personal thing. Your bike should fit you, not the other way around. So when you throw a leg over it and pull away from the curb, you should be feeling there isn't another bike in the world you'd rather be sitting on. That's how a motorcycle equipped with the right gear can make your time on the road as rewarding as possible.

C B

CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT A comfortable seat, hand and foot position triangle is essential if you are looking to pile up the miles. But it's not the only thing. Protection from the wind, temperature management, suspension settings and back support all factor into how far you can ride.

EQUIPPED FOR THE LONG HAUL Depending on the trip, your riding equipment may have to change at a moment's notice. That's why Harley-Davidson offers an entire array of quick-detach road accessories. From windshields and saddlebags to seats and backrests, your ride can flex between a stripped-down street machine and a fully loaded touring beast in seconds.

SPORTSTER® COMFORT ESSENTIALS
A DETACHABLE WINDSHIELD B DETACHABLE SEAT C DETACHABLE BACKREST

By diverting air pressure away from your chest, a windshield can add hours of riding comfort. For quick on-and-off convenience, snap on a Quick-Release windshield.

Seats are available to fit a variety of riders and riding styles. From a low-profile street look to cross-country comfort, quick-detach Seat Hardware lets you change at a moment's notice.

A Detachable Sissy Bar Upright and Passenger Backrest add support and comfort and provide your passenger a sense of security without grabbing the rider around the waist.

CAF É C U S TOM
A Café bike starts with a "less-is-more" philosophy. Low-slung bars, rear-set foot controls and a narrow profile define the style. And when stripped of all "unnecessary" accessories, these unburdened motorcycles are lighter, faster and have a harder-edged, rebellious look that reflects the rider's bare-knuckle attitude.

This Iron 883TM model is caffeine fueled, fully wired, and ready to carve up back roads. Equipped with a suite of Café Custom components and a Screamin' Eagle fully adjustable suspension, this aggressive riding profile puts you firmly in control.

For the ultimate in aggressive riding posture, Rear Set Foot Controls reposition your feet to encourage a tank-hugging profile.

A. CAFÉ CUSTOM TAIL SECTION Create your own link to the Sportster®-based racing and performance bikes of the '60s and '70s. This fast-back solo seat and tail section mirrors the look and feel of the iconic 1977-78 Harley-Davidson ® XLCR Café Racer model, and re-imagines the style for the modern era. Ideal for use with Clip-On or Sportster Clubman Handlebars and mid- or rear-set foot controls, this seat provides the perfect lay-down aggressive riding posture for splitting lanes or carving corners. The seat's upturned tail and longer nose positions the solo rider closer to the tank for better weight balance, quicker steering and added front-end feedback. The Tail Section is a true bolton design that wraps the fender struts, so unlike other café bike kits, there is no cutting, welding or frame modifications required. Installation is reversible ­ you can easily return your bike to the stock look. The complete kit features a sweeping composite tail section with a steel inner support, a deep solo bucket seat with backstop pad, and all necessary installation hardware.

C. PERFORMANCE SUSPENSION KIT ­ XR1200 Maximize the canyon-carving ability of your XR1200 motorcycle with this complete Performance Suspension Kit. Fullyadjustable light-weight suspension system features Showa's new Big Piston Front fork (BPF) design. The BPF eliminates many of the internal components used in a cartridge-type fork, simplifying construction and resulting in lighter overall fork weight. The large-diameter of the BPF's internal piston allows a reduction in damping pressure, for better feedback and smoother action. This performance suspension kit also provides a very controlled feeling which leads to more rider confidence. The BPF's rebound and compression damping force settings are easily fine-tuned via two adjuster screws located on top of the fork bolts. The spring pre-load is adjusted via a M5 hex screw on the axle holders. The rear Showa® shocks feature 36mm pistons with piggyback nitrogen-charged reservoirs. The compression damping can be adjusted via a knob on top of the piggyback reservoir. The rebound is adjusted with a thumb wheel on the lower clevis. Rear spring pre-load is also adjustable on the shock for optimum 1G sag. The kit includes one set of Big Piston Front Forks and one set of rear shocks.
54530-10 $1,499.95 Fits '08-'13 XR1200 models. Stock on '10-'13 XR1200X models. Does not fit with Sport Saddlebag Kit P/N 90328-08.

A. PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT* This Single Sided Cartridge Fork provides improved handling performance by keeping the tire in contact with the road surface. Tuned to work in concert with the Premium Emulsion Rear Shocks, the fork damping is controlled by a specifically calibrated piston and valve stack. Unlike typical orifice damping, the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads, inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel, and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive, and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking ­ giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop. A perfect addition during the installation of chrome or gloss black lower fork sliders, the kit includes fork pipe, cartridge, fork bolts, main springs and oil seals. 45400091 Standard Height. $349.95 Fits '04-'15 XL883, XL883C, XL883R, XL1200R, and XL1200V and '04-'10 XL1200C models. 45400090 Low-Profile. $349.95 A. PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT Fits '11-'15 XL883, XL1200C and XL1200T and '06-'11 (STANDARD HEIGHT) XL1200L models. B. PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCKS* Experience a comfortable and confidence-inspiring ride ­ no matter the pavement conditions ­ with Harley-Davidson® Premium Ride Emulsion Shocks. These fast shocks offer enhanced compression and rebound damping control when compared to typical twin-tube shock absorbers. The nitrogen gas charged shocks resist oil aeration and work with the internal valve stack to provide superior damping control in the twisties. The large pistons and low viscosity high-performance oil allow these shocks to react quickly to impacts and keep the tires tracking the road surface. With the addition of urethane bumpers, you get a controlled ride and minimized bottoming harshness. The locking threaded adjustment lets you fine tune the spring preload to your current riding conditions ­ whether a solo run on the back roads or a fully-loaded two-up freeway tour. Kit includes left and right shock and preload adjustment spanner wrench. 54000076 Standard Height. $599.95 Fits '04-'15 XL models (except XL883C, XL1200T, '11-'15 XL883L, '04-'11 XL1200C and '06-'07 XL1200L). 54000077 Low-Profile. $599.95 Fits '04-'15 XL models (except XL883, XL883R, XL1200R and XL1200T).

F I N D I N G THE R I G H T F I T
The relationship between the seat, the handlebar and the foot controls has an enormous impact on the comfort, control, and confidence you feel when riding your motorcycle. Once you've picked the bike, it's time to choose the options that match your ride to your personal dimensions.

E S TA B LISH YOUR POSI T ION

SUSPENS ION
Adjusting your motorcycle's ride height by raising or lowering the suspension is often the first step in fitting the bike to your stature. Being sure-footed at a stop can really increase your sense of confidence.

SEATS
Seat height and shape impact rider comfort, fit and confidence. Where the seat positions you relative to the foot controls, hand controls and the ground plays a major role in the quality of your ride.

HA NDL EBA RS
Where the bar positions your arms, hands and wrists directly impacts how you feel on the motorcycle. Choose a bar that falls easily to hand, and does not pull you out of the seat when maneuvering.

FOOT CONTRO L S
Repositioning your feet can relieve muscle tension, take pressure off the tailbone and reduce fatigue. The correct riding position can add hours of comfort and hundreds of miles to your daily saddle time.

Foot Controls
SPORTSTER® FOOT CONTROLS A long stretch to the controls or a knees-high cramped riding position puts strain on your body after even a short ride. Repositioning your feet on the controls relieves muscle tension, takes pressure off the tail bone, and reduces rider fatigue. Where your feet contact the controls can often determine how many miles you can put on in a day.
Many Sportster® models can be equipped with the following foot control configurations:
3.50" EXTENDED REACH FORWARD CONTROLS FORWARD CONTROLS 3.67" FURTHER FORWARD MID-CONTROLS 9.89" 2.00" REDUCED REACH FORWARD CONTROLS

MID-CONTROLS: Original Equipment on some models, Mid-Controls position the feet below the knee for a sporting riding posture. FURTHER FORWARD MID-CONTROLS: Achieves a comfortable foot-down riding position for the taller rider. REDUCED REACH FORWARD CONTROLS: Provides a foot-forward boulevard style without straining to reach the controls. STANDARD FORWARD CONTROLS: Places the legs for a "feet-in the-wind" laid back profiling posture. EXTENDED REACH FORWARD CONTROLS: Accommodates the tallest rider by stretching the leg a full 3.5" further forward.

COMFORT

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | DYNA® COMFORT

COMFORT IS KEY Bikes are a personal thing. Your bike should fit you, not the other way around. So when you throw a leg over it and pull away from the curb, you should be feeling there isn't another bike in the world you'd rather be sitting on. That's how a motorcycle equipped with the right gear can make your time on the road as rewarding as possible.

A

CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT A comfortable seat, hand and foot position triangle is essential if you are looking to pile up the miles. But it's not the only thing. Protection from the wind, temperature management, suspension settings and back support all factor into how far you can ride.

C B

EQUIPPED FOR THE LONG HAUL Depending on the trip, your riding equipment may have to change at a moment's notice. That's why Harley-Davidson offers an entire array of quick-detach road accessories. From windshields and saddlebags to seats and backrests, your ride can flex between a stripped-down street machine and a fully loaded touring beast in seconds.

DYNA® COMFORT ESSENTIALS
A DETACHABLE WINDSHIELD B DETACHABLE SEAT C DETACHABLE BACKREST

By diverting air pressure away from your chest, a windshield can add hours of riding comfort. For quick on-and-off convenience, snap on a Quick-Release windshield.

Seats are available to fit a variety of riders and riding styles. From a low-profile street look to cross-country comfort, quick-detach Seat Hardware lets you change at a moment's notice.

A Detachable Sissy Bar Upright and Passenger Backrest add support and comfort and provide your passenger a sense of security without grabbing the rider around the waist.

A. ROAD ZEPPELIN® SEAT PAD Experience ultimate comfort. Designed to ensure hours of comfort in the saddle, Road Zeppelin® Seat Pads are equipped with a unique air bladder system that allows your weight to be supported evenly across the entire seating surface. Whether you have a low profile seat or a larger more comfortable seat, you will feel the benefits. This air bladder system is designed to reduce pressure points, provide shock absorption, and reduce vibration. Unlike other mouth-inflated seat pads, the Road Zeppelin Pad features an easy-to-reach integrated hand pump and metered air release valve that permits quick and controllable adjustment. You can easily adjust the comfort and support while seated on the pad. The UV-stable and snag resistant mesh cover allows air to circulate beneath the rider's body, reducing the temperature trapped between the rider and seat. Shaped to conform to most Harley-Davidson® seats, the pads feature adjustable mounting straps and a non-skid surface to keep them in place. The hand-washable seat pad can be deflated and rolled for compact storage. 52000327 Rider. $169.95 Fits rider position on all models equipped with Original Equipment or accessory seats.

F I N D I N G THE R I G H T F I T
The relationship between the seat, the handlebar and the foot controls has an enormous impact on the comfort, control, and confidence you feel when riding your motorcycle. Once you've picked the bike, it's time to choose the options that match your ride to your personal dimensions.

E S TA B LISH YOUR POSI T ION

SUSPENS ION
Adjusting your motorcycle's ride height by raising or lowering the suspension is often the first step in fitting the bike to your stature. Being sure-footed at a stop can really increase your sense of confidence.

SEATS
Seat height and shape impact rider comfort, fit and confidence. Where the seat positions you relative to the foot controls, hand controls and the ground plays a major role in the quality of your ride.

HA NDL EBA RS
Where the bar positions your arms, hands and wrists directly impacts how you feel on the motorcycle. Choose a bar that falls easily to hand, and does not pull you out of the seat when maneuvering.

FOOT CONTRO L S
Repositioning your feet can relieve muscle tension, take pressure off the tailbone and reduce fatigue. The correct riding position can add hours of comfort and hundreds of miles to your daily saddle time.

Suspension
A. PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT* This Single Sided Cartridge Fork provides improved handling performance by keeping the tire in contact with the road surface. Tuned to work in concert with the Premium Emulsion Rear Shocks, the fork damping is controlled by a specifically calibrated piston and valve stack. Unlike typical orifice damping, the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads, inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel, and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive, and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking ­ giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop. A perfect addition during the installation of chrome or gloss black lower fork sliders, the kit includes fork pipe, cartridge, fork bolts, main springs and oil seals.
45400058 $349.95 Fits '06-'17 Dyna® models (except FLD, FXDWG and '07-'08 FXDSE). Original Equipment on FXDLS models.

A. PREMIUM RIDE SINGLE CARTRIDGE FORK KIT

B. PREMIUM RIDE EMULSION SHOCKS* Experience a comfortable and confidence-inspiring ride ­ no matter the pavement conditions ­ with Harley-Davidson® Premium Ride Emulsion Shocks. These fast acting monotube nitrogen gas-charged shocks offer enhanced compression and rebound damping control when compared to typical twin-tube shock absorbers. The nitrogen gas charged shocks resist oil aeration and work with the internal valve stack to provide superior damping control in the twisties. The large 36mm pistons and low viscosity high-performance oil allow these shocks to react quickly to impacts and keep the tires tracking the road surface. You get a controlled ride and minimized bottoming harshness transmitted through the frame. The locking threaded adjustment lets you fine tune the spring preload to your current riding conditions ­ whether a solo run on the back roads or a fully-loaded two-up freeway tour ­ and urethane bumpers provide a softer feel if the shock bottoms under load. The beautifully-finished shocks feature black-anodized billet top caps and black progressively-wound springs. Kit includes left and right shock and preload adjustment spanner wrench. 54000066 Stock Height. $599.95 Fits '06-'17 Dyna models (except FLD and '07-'08 FXDSE). Original Equipment on FXDLS models. C. PREMIUM PROFILE® LOW REAR SUSPENSION KIT* Introduced on the '08 FXDF model, these custom rear shocks lower your bike while they raise the level of style. These lowprofile shocks lower the seat height by approximately 1.0". The rear shock and spring is completely covered with mirrorpolished and chrome-plated sleeves for a sleek, beefy look.

*WARNING: Installation of any accessory suspension components may affect cornering clearance and jiffy stand operation. This could distract the rider, causing loss of control and death or serious injury. *WARNING: The Profile Low Front Spring Kit cannot be used independently and must be used with the appropriate Profile Rear Shock Lowering Kit.

Foot Controls
DYNA® FOOT CONTROL* A long stretch to the controls or a knees-high cramped riding position puts strain on your body after even a short ride. Repositioning your feet on the controls relieves muscle tension, takes pressure off the tail bone, and reduces rider fatigue. Where your feet contact the controls can often determine how many miles you can put on in a day.
Dyna® models can be equipped with the following foot control configurations:

1.19"

FORWARD CONTROLS REDUCED REACH FORWARD CONTROLS FOOTBOARD 2.08" MID-CONTROLS FURTHER FORWARD MID-CONTROLS 7.05" 9.94" 11.17"

COMFORT

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | MILWAUKEE-EIGHT® SOFTAIL® COMFORT

COMFORT IS KEY Bikes are a personal thing. Your bike should fit you, not the other way around. So when you throw a leg over it and pull away from the curb, you should be feeling there isn't another bike in the world you'd rather be sitting on. That's how a motorcycle equipped with the right gear can make your time on the road as rewarding as possible.

A

CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT A comfortable seat, hand and foot position triangle is essential if you are looking to pile up the miles. But it's not the only thing. Protection from the wind, temperature management, suspension settings and back support all factor into how far you can ride.

C B

EQUIPPED FOR THE LONG HAUL Depending on the trip, your riding equipment may have to change at a moment's notice. That's why Harley-Davidson offers an entire array of quick-detach road accessories. From windshields and saddlebags to seats and backrests, your ride can flex between a stripped-down street machine and a fully loaded touring beast in seconds.

Hand Controls
CHROME HAND CONTROL COMPONENTS The flash of chrome. It's the first thing that everyone sees. And the one thing that everyone remembers.

Windshields ­ FL Softail® & SpringerTM
A. WIND SPLITTER VENTED WINDSHIELD Reduce helmet buffeting at speed. The Harley-Davidson ® DetachablesTM Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbulence behind the windscreen. When open, the controlled airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and around the rider. The revised flow reduces helmet bobbing and neck fatigue so you can comfortably spend more time in the saddle. The open vent also provides cooling airflow to the rider at low speeds and in city traffic.
Engineered to provide the riding comfort of a larger windshield, this low-profile screen's contemporary contour sets it apart from the crowd. The shape keeps the windshield below your siteline so you don't look through bugs and road grime and the detachable design means you can ride without the shield when the mood strikes. The shield is formed of hard-coated polycarbonate for strength and scratch resistance and the dark-smoked finish reduces glare. The slim polished stainless steel brackets mount to the Original Equipment rubber isolated docking points for ease of installation and removal.

NOTE: Some Harley-Davidson® seats are made of leather. Fine leathers or other natural materials WILL gain "character," such as wrinkles or wear, with age. This is normal. A fine, aged patina and character wrinkles are a sign of the extremely high quality materials used to construct your seat or backrest. The appearance of scars or marks on the leather are a result of using natural leather panels and should not be thought of as an imperfection. Please use Harley-Davidson Leather Protectant P/N 93600034 to protect your investment.

A. BOBBER SOLO SADDLE How low can you go? This minimalist solo seat takes the stripped-down garage-built look about as far as you can go.

NOTE: Some Harley-Davidson® seats are made of leather. Fine leathers or other natural materials WILL gain "character," such as wrinkles or wear, with age. This is normal. A fine, aged patina and character wrinkles are a sign of the extremely high quality materials used to construct your seat or backrest. The appearance of scars or marks on the leather are a result of using natural leather panels and should not be thought of as an imperfection. Please use Harley-Davidson Leather Protectant P/N 93600034 to protect your investment.

A. ROAD ZEPPELIN® SEAT PAD Experience ultimate comfort. Designed to ensure hours of comfort in the saddle, Road Zeppelin® Seat Pads are equipped with a unique air bladder system that allows your weight to be supported evenly across the entire seating surface. Whether you have a low profile seat or a larger more comfortable seat, you will feel the benefits. This air bladder system is designed to reduce pressure points, provide shock absorption, and reduce vibration. Unlike other mouth-inflated seat pads, the Road Zeppelin Pad features an easy-to-reach integrated hand pump and metered air release valve that permits quick and controllable adjustment. You can easily adjust the comfort and support while seated on the pad. The UV-stable and snag resistant mesh cover allows air to circulate beneath the rider's body, reducing the temperature trapped between the rider and seat.

Designed to keep the rider cool by reducing the perspiration build-up between you and the seating surface, the Circulator Pad can be installed and removed in seconds for easy cleaning. The low-profile design minimizes seat-height change compared to inflatable pads, while enhancing comfort with its shock-absorbing construction. Manufactured of UV-stable materials, these seat pads resist fading when exposed to the sun. Elastic under-seat strap and non-slip base provide secure installation and the available Circulator Passenger Pillion Pad attaches to the rider pad with hook-and-loop tabs. 51076-10 Large Seat Pad. $89.95 Fits Softail, Touring and Trike models with Original Equipment and accessory seats.

STEP 1 Equipped with large capacity saddlebags, your bike is ready to take on the longest journey.

STEP 2 Pull and turn the hidden cam lock to release the bags from the docking hardware.

NOTE: Some Harley-Davidson® saddlebags are made of leather. Fine leathers or other natural materials WILL gain "character," such as wrinkles or wear, with age. This is normal. A fine, aged patina and character wrinkles are a sign of the extremely high quality materials used to construct your saddlebags. The appearance of scars or marks on the leather are a result of using natural leather panels and should not be thought of as an imperfection. Please use Harley-Davidson Leather Protectant P/N 93600034 to protect your investment.

F I N D I N G THE R I G H T F I T
The relationship between the seat, the handlebar and the foot controls has an enormous impact on the comfort, control, and confidence you feel when riding your motorcycle. Once you've picked the bike, it's time to choose the options that match your ride to your personal dimensions.

E S TA B LISH YOUR POSI T ION

SUSPENS ION
Adjusting your motorcycle's ride height by raising or lowering the suspension is often the first step in fitting the bike to your stature. Being sure-footed at a stop can really increase your sense of confidence.

SEATS
Seat height and shape impact rider comfort, fit and confidence. Where the seat positions you relative to the foot controls, hand controls and the ground plays a major role in the quality of your ride.

HA NDL EBA RS
Where the bar positions your arms, hands and wrists directly impacts how you feel on the motorcycle. Choose a bar that falls easily to hand, and does not pull you out of the seat when maneuvering.

FOOT CONTRO L S
Repositioning your feet can relieve muscle tension, take pressure off the tailbone and reduce fatigue. The correct riding position can add hours of comfort and hundreds of miles to your daily saddle time.

COMFORT

HARLEY-DAVIDSON® | TOURING COMFORT

COMFORT IS KEY Bikes are a personal thing. Your bike should fit you, not the other way around. So when you throw a leg over it and pull away from the curb, you should be feeling there isn't another bike in the world you'd rather be sitting on. That's how a motorcycle equipped with the right gear can make your time on the road as rewarding as possible.

A

CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT A comfortable seat, hand and foot position triangle is essential if you are looking to pile up the miles. But it's not the only thing. Protection from the wind, temperature management, suspension settings and back support all factor into how far you can ride.

C B

LIGHTEN THE LOAD A fully-loaded touring bike is perfect for epic rides across the country, but when fighting city traffic on a daily commute, an H-D® DetachablesTM Conversion Kit allows easy removal of the Tour-Pak® luggage for added maneuverability around town. Your ride can flex between a stripped-down street machine and a fully loaded touring beast in seconds.

By diverting air around the rider, a windshield can add hours of riding comfort. Select a windshield height that reduces turbulence and helmet buffeting for the rider and passenger.

Seats are available to fit a variety of riders and riding styles. From a low-profile street look to cross-country comfort, quick-detach Seat Hardware lets you change at a moment's notice.

A Detachable Sissy Bar Upright and Passenger Backrest add support and comfort, and provide your passenger a sense of security without grabbing the rider around the waist.

D E F Y THE W I N D
At highway speed, you take the wind full-force in the chest, causing fatigue in your arms, neck and shoulders. Take the pressure off with an easy-to-install detachable windshield. Shaped to divert air, rain and road debris around the rider, a windshield can add hours of riding comfort.

A. WIND SPLITTER VENTED WINDSHIELD Reduce helmet buffeting at speed. The Harley-Davidson ® DetachablesTM Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbulence behind the windscreen. When open, the controlled airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and around the rider. The revised flow reduces helmet bobbing and neck fatigue so you can comfortably spend more time in the saddle. The open vent also provides cooling airflow to the rider at low speeds and in city traffic.
Engineered to provide the riding comfort of a larger windshield, this low-profile screen's contemporary contour sets it apart from the crowd. The shape keeps the windshield below your site line so you don't look through bugs and road grime and the detachable design means you can ride without the shield when the mood strikes. The shield is formed of hard-coated polycarbonate for strength and scratch resistance and the dark-smoked finish reduces glare. The slim polished stainless steel brackets mount to the Original Equipment rubber isolated docking points for ease of installation and removal.

Rider Comfort
A. COOLFLOWTM FAN Keep your cool on a sweltering summer day. Engineered to maximize rider and passenger comfort in high temperature situations, the CoolFlowTM Fan is the perfect addition if your bike is subjected to parade duty, rush hour traffic, or extreme temperature environments. Unlike traditional fan kits that try to cool the engine by blowing air across the cylinders and often onto your legs, the CoolFlow Fan Kit keeps the riders comfortable by pulling air away from the rear cylinder and exhaust pipe, and directing it toward the ground. The fan suction generates a low pressure region near the riders to balance the natural "up and out" convection air flow in the area behind the engine. The wind-tunnel tested fan is tucked away above the transmission, and when combined with midframe air deflectors, significantly drops the temperature the seated rider experiences.
The CoolFlow Fan features switched On/Off/Auto operation. In the "ON" mode, the fan is active at low speeds, and will turn off when the bike reaches 40mph. As speed drops, the fan turns back on at 35mph. This logic program prevents the fan from cycling on and off during low speed changes. In the AUTO setting, the fan operates based on a combination of speed parameters and specific engine and ambient temperatures. Built to withstand the harsh motorcycle environment, the all-weather CoolFlow Fan is 100% waterproof and includes everything you need for installation. The plug-and-play design is integrated with the vehicle electronics, so "On/Off/Auto" fan operation is indicated in the odometer screen. Your dealer will enable this function in the Electronic Control Module (ECM) and you're ready to roll.

This easy to install Oil Cooler features a thermostatically controlled fan that provides continuous flow of cooling air ­ even while the bike is idling in traffic or moving at low speed. Ideal for bikes that see parade duty and other low speed or continuous idle situations, the Fan Assisted Oil Cooler is also the perfect addition to a bike modified with high performance components. The fan automatically engages when the engine oil temperature rises, and when in operation, the Fan Assisted Oil Cooler can provide up to a 50 degree drop in oil temperature. And unlike other models, the HarleyDavidson® Fan Assisted Oil Cooler utilizes weather-rated fans and electronics that are designed for the harsh motorcycle environment. Engineered as a bolt-on replacement for the Original Equipment oil cooler, the Fan Assisted Oil Cooler is plug-and-play compatible with your bike's wiring harness.

C. PREMIUM OIL COOLER KITS ­ TOURING This oil cooler was designed specifically for Harley-Davidson to out-perform all other coolers in the industry.

The oil cooler has been designed to simplify installation and enhance performance. The large heat exchanger provides excellent cooling efficiency. The kit features a one-piece adapter plate with integrated thermostat that allows oil lines to connect to the oil filter bracket. Thermostat activates at 185°F (85°C). Kit comes complete with mounting hardware and precut oil lines.

Turbulators disperse and mix oil inside cooler to provide more efficient cooling capabilities. The cooler oil is not allowed to remain along the boundaries of the flow tube as in conventional coolers.

Coolers without the Turbulator system allow oil to flow only in a straight path. Oil does not mix and the cooler oil remains along the outer boundaries, while the hotter oil remains along the center path of flow. Without the mixing effects of the Turbulators, the conventional oil cooler provides less efficient cooling capabilities.

The ability to spend hours behind the handlebars and rack up hundreds of miles without stopping is dictated by how you feel on your bike. The shape of the seat, the reach to the handlebars and the location of your feet are all major factors in how far you can travel in a day. But don't forget your passenger's needs -- they have a stake in this ride as well.

THE RIDER & PASSENGER ENVIRONMENT
Accessories that impact the rider and passenger's physical contact with the motorcycle and the management of wind, temperature and road conditions should be your first consideration in building the ultimate touring machine.

The Signature Series® Solo Seat features a built-in, fully adjustable and removable rider backrest for added support. The backrest provides a 5-position height adjustment with 1.5" range and a wide range of forward/back adjustment with a quick twist of the control knob. The backrest pad features a sleek shape that provides full lower back support without pushing the rider forward. When combined with the comfortable Passenger Pillion P/N 52000133 or 51770-09 (sold separately), the slim profile of the rider backrest offers the passenger a few more inches of space and the fold-down design permits easy passenger mounting/dismounting. The rich vinyl seating surface is easy to clean and maintain and features an embossed Bar & Shield logo on the side skirts for a finishing touch.

F I N D I N G THE R I G H T F I T
The relationship between the seat, the handlebar and the foot controls has an enormous impact on the comfort, control, and confidence you feel when riding your motorcycle. Once you've picked the bike, it's time to choose the options that match your ride to your personal dimensions.

E S TA B LISH YOUR POSI T ION

SUSPENS ION
Adjusting your motorcycle's ride height by raising or lowering the suspension is often the first step in fitting the bike to your stature. Being sure-footed at a stop can really increase your sense of confidence.

SEATS
Seat height and shape impact rider comfort, fit and confidence. Where the seat positions you relative to the foot controls, hand controls and the ground plays a major role in the quality of your ride.

HA NDL EBA RS
Where the bar positions your arms, hands and wrists directly impacts how you feel on the motorcycle. Choose a bar that falls easily to hand, and does not pull you out of the seat when maneuvering.

FOOT CONTRO L S
Repositioning your feet can relieve muscle tension, take pressure off the tailbone and reduce fatigue. The correct riding position can add hours of comfort and hundreds of miles to your daily saddle time.

A. PREMIUM RIDE HAND-ADJUSTABLE TOURING SHOCKS* Experience the ultimate in superior ride quality with these Premium Touring Shocks. These shocks utilize a single tube, nitrogen charged emulsion design. The design offers enhanced compression and rebound damping compared to the Original Equipment-style air adjustable shocks. This provides a controlled yet plush ride with much less bottoming. Larger chambers (40mm diameter pistons and 14mm rods) allow these shocks to react more quickly to impacts. This keeps the tires tracking while minimizing harshness transmitted through the frame. A simple knob behind the left saddlebag allows the rider to conveniently modify the spring preload via a hydraulic adjuster. Available in Standard Ride Height and Low Ride Height versions. 54000008 Standard-Height. $549.95 Fits '09-'16 Touring models (except models equipped with lowered front ends). 54000091 Low-Profile. $549.95 Fits '09-'16 Touring models.

A. CUSTOM WRAPPED FRONT FENDER Give your bike a big hug. This all-steel fender is shaped to show off the full profile of your 19" front wheel. The apronless fender wraps almost 180 degrees around the front tire for a clean, custom appearance, and the low profile cutaway design exposes the wheel from hub to rim for maximum visual impact. Designed for mistake-proof installation, the fender is pre-drilled to fit Original Equipment fender mounting bosses, and does not require additional fender spacers or install kits. Available in Color-Matched, Vivid Black or primed and readyto-paint finish.
Fits '14-later Touring models equipped with a 17", 18" or 19" wheel and tire combination. Does not fit with Fender Tip Assembly P/N 59600003 or 59600006. Does not fit Trike models.

B. CUSTOM STRETCHED SIDE COVERS Add a long, lean look to the profile of your Touring bike. These Stretched Side Covers are sculpted to smooth the visual transition from the side of the bike to the front of the saddlebag, and trade the traditional stepped look for a rearward flowing design. Shaped to flare out and down the saddlebag face, the sleek side covers complement the body lines and eliminate the saddlebag guard clearance notch at the lower corner for a seamless flow. And unlike some aftermarket designs, these side covers fit without significantly compromising the available passenger foot space. The one-piece covers are a snapin replacement for the Original Equipment covers, and require no bonding or modification for installation.

BENEFITS

Ideal for riders that want to enhance the performance, look and sound of their motorcycle

TORQUE KIT: Ideal for riders looking for instant passing power at cruising speeds POWER KIT: Ideal for riders who want to feel the power build and pull all the way to the redline

Ideal for riders who want the largest engine displacement and increased power throughout the entire RPM range

Ideal for riders who want the absolute best Harley-Davidson performance upgrade available

· Most cost-effective step to improve performance and the foundation for future performance upgrades

· Choose a torque cam or power cam based on riding style · A performance cam increases both the lift in the valve train (pushing the valve open further) and the duration of the valve opening (how long the valve stays open)

BASICS

· Match any Screamin' Eagle® high-flow air cleaner and exhaust with the proper ECM calibration to increase the air flow into and out of the engine

· An increase in engine displacement allows the engine to swallow more air and fuel, while a higher compression piston squeezes the air and fuel into a more volatile mixture, generating more power when ignited · Displacement increases are accomplished with larger cylinders, matching pistons and the proper cam upgrade

· Highest level-performance upgrade available to provide a maximum increase in displacement, compression and flow · Higher-flowing CNC ported cylinder heads and larger bore throttle body increase the velocity and feed large volumes of air and fuel into the engine, which maximizes power on a larger displacement engine · Combines ported cylinder heads and larger throttle body in combination with cylinders, matching pistons and proper cam upgrade

PERFORMANCE

The rider will feel up to a 10%* increase in performance when compared to stock bikes throughout the entire RPM range

TORQUE

· The rider will feel up to a 15%* increase in performance when compared to stock bikes in the low- to mid-RPM range · Experience crisp throttle response and acceleration that can be felt at slower speeds, perfect for passing slow moving vehicles without downshifting · The rider will feel up to a 25%* increase in performance when compared to stock bikes in the mid-RPM to upper RPM range

· Riders will experience a performance increase throughout the entire RPM range, with up to a 35%* increase when compared to stock bikes in the mid- to upper-RPM range · Produces instant passing power without downshifting · Delivers excellent stoplight to freeway speed and on-ramp acceleration

The rider will feel exceptional acceleration, delivering significant gains and up to a 40%* increase when compared to stock bikes in the upper-RPM range

POWER

· Experience an adrenaline-pumping burst of speed while heading toward the redline

Ideal for real-world street performance applications, the Pro Street Tuner provides the adjustability to account for bike-to-bike variation and for changes to cams, heads, intake and exhaust while maintaining closed-loop fuel control for fuel economy in the part-throttle operating range. Unlike other aftermarket tuners, The Screamin' Eagle Pro Street Tuner actually talks directly to your motorcycle's ECM and re-programs the motorcycle's operating system. It isn't a piggyback system that tries to fool the ECM into adding more fuel or changing the ignition timing. The Pro Street Tuner plugs into the bike's data port, so no splicing or under-seat hardware is required. After you upload the proper ECM calibration, dial it in with the Smart Tune function. The guided Smart Tune process walks you through the process to; find the right calibration for your build, set the tuner to a data collection mode and then allows you to incorporate the data after the ride with just a few clicks. The ECM calibration is then custom fit for your bike. The module will store up to 15 minutes of run-time data information that can be downloaded to your PC, allowing the rider or technician to view and evaluate the bike's air/fuel ratio, O2 sensor readings, engine speed and temperature, RPM and vehicle speed, throttle position, spark advance and many more performance characteristics. The Vehicle Communications Module (VCI) will also record and display service codes for troubleshooting and diagnostics. The kit includes the VCI module and unlimited access to the latest software updates and calibrations available from Screamin' Eagle. Tuner Cable kit sold separately.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE® SMART TUNE PRO 2 AUTOMATIC TUNING MODULE* Smart Tune PRO works with the Screamin' Eagle Pro Street Tuner to automatically adjust your bike for the combination of performance components, climates, and vehicle load conditions you are operating in. You just install the upgraded wideband oxygen sensors in the exhaust headers, download the calibration that the Screamin' Eagle engineers have developed as a starting point, then simply drive down the road and let Smart Tune Pro do the work. Ride from the flatlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Colorado without a compromise in performance.
Smart Tune PRO constantly monitors the operating parameters of your motorcycle, and automatically adjusts the bike's Electronic Control Module (ECM) to maximize performance in your current riding conditions. Smart Tune Pro utilizes wideband O2 sensors that read oxygen levels in the exhaust stream to determine the optimum air/fuel ratio your bike needs at this very moment. Smart Tune Pro analyzes the data and automatically makes real-time tuning adjustments to the ECM. Unlike the standard narrow-band O2 sensors that only provide feedback in the part-throttle cruising range, the wideband sensors can read and adjust tuning throughout the part throttle cruising and full-throttle acceleration operating range. Screamin' Eagle Smart Tune Pro was developed by the Screamin' Eagle engineering team in concert with the design of your Harley-Davidson ® motorcycle.

Milwaukee-Eight® Stage Upgrades

MILWAUKEE-EIGHT POWERTRAIN
Screamin' Eagle® Stage upgrades offer complete street-compliant performance configurations engineered to generate specific torque and horsepower gains. Eliminating all the guesswork and trial-and-error testing normally associated with engine modifications, Stage upgrades include everything you need to enhance your bike's performance. You can start with key components that give you a bump in power right now, add components as time and budget permits, or you can go for it all at once.

®

STAGE I
INTAKE + EXHAUST + TUNING
The easiest and most cost effective step to improve your motorcycle's performance is to increase the air flow into and out of the engine. A high-flow air cleaner and system-matched slip-on mufflers provide horsepower and torque improvements you can feel throughout the RPM range, and serve as the core components for all performance upgrades. ECM calibration is required to tune the fuel flow and timing required to accommodate the improved air flow.
Stage I upgrade can be installed without engine disassembly. No special tools are required. Requires ECM tuning.

Milwaukee-Eight® Stage Upgrades

STAGE II
STAGE I + CAM UPGRADE
Adding performance cams to a Stage I equipped bike is the next step to improved performance. Cam choices allow you to tailor the engine's performance to your specific needs. A torque cam offers on-demand throttle response from low- to mid-RPM at cruising speed. A power cam targets high-rpm, wide-open throttle response that keeps pulling right up to the redline. ECM calibration tuning is required to accommodate the increased valve timing, and performance valve springs may be required for high-lift cams.
Stage II upgrade requires minor engine disassembly to replace the cam. Adjustable pushrods allow cam installation without removing the rocker box. Special tools and ECM tuning are required.

STAGE III
STAGE I + CAM, BIG BORE CYLINDERS & PISTONS
The next step on the performance journey is to build a bigger engine. An increase in engine displacement allows the engine to swallow more air and fuel, a higher compression piston squeezes the air/fuel into a more volatile mixture, and when combined, generates more power when ignited. A displacement and compression increase provides torque increases throughout the entire RPM range with a 15-25% improvement in the mid-range power. ECM calibration tuning is required to adjust fuel flow and timing to accommodate the increased displacement.

Stage III bolt-on upgrade requires removal of the engine's top-end and opening the cam chest. Engine remains in the chassis and no machining is required. Special tools and ECM tuning are required.

STAGE IV
SCREAMIN' EAGLE
STAGE I + CAM, BIG BORE CYLINDERS, PISTONS, CYLINDER HEADS & THROTTLE BODY
To maximize the impact of the increased displacement gained with Stage III updates, the addition of free-flowing ported cylinder heads and a big bore throttle body top off the performance build. Designed to satisfy the high RPM, throttle twisting rider, the Stage IV update delivers 20-30% increase in power that keeps pulling right up to the redline, without sacrificing mid-range torque. ECM calibration tuning is required to add more fuel, and a higher-lift cam may be required to deliver maximum power.
Stage IV bolt-on upgrade requires removal of the engine's top-end and opening the cam chest. Engine remains in the chassis and no machining is required. Special tools and ECM tuning are required.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE® HIGH-FLOW EXHAUST 2 SYSTEM WITH STREET CANNON MUFFLERS The Screamin' Eagle® High-Flow Exhaust system provides bolt-on performance by reducing the catalyst restrictions and improving exhaust flow. This exhaust system is optimized for use with Screamin' Eagle Stage Kit-equipped MilwaukeeEight® engines.

Twin Cam Stage Upgrades

TWIN CAM POWERTRAIN
Screamin' Eagle® Stage upgrades offer complete street-compliant performance configurations engineered to generate specific torque and horsepower gains. Eliminating all the guesswork and trial-and-error testing normally associated with engine modifications, Stage upgrades include everything you need to enhance your bike's performance. You can start with key components that give you a bump in power right now, add components as time and budget permits, or you can go for it all at once.

STAGE I
INTAKE + EXHAUST + TUNING
Corrected Rear Wheel Torque (lb-ft)
The easiest and most cost effective step to improve your motorcycle's performance is to increase the air flow into and out of the engine. A high-flow air cleaner and system-matched slip-on mufflers provide horsepower and torque improvements you can feel throughout the RPM range, and serve as the core components for all performance upgrades. ECM calibration is required to tune the fuel flow and timing required to accommodate the improved air flow.

Twin Cam Stage Upgrades

STAGE II
STAGE I + CAM UPGRADE
Adding performance cams to a Stage I equipped bike is the next step to improved performance. Cam choices allow you to tailor the engine's performance to your specific needs. A torque cam offers on-demand throttle response from low- to mid-RPM at cruising speed. A power cam targets high-rpm, wide-open throttle response that keeps pulling right up to redline. ECM calibration tuning is required to accommodate the increased valve timing, and performance valve springs may be required for highlift cams.
Stage II upgrade requires minor engine disassembly to replace the cam. Adjustable pushrods allow cam installation without removing the rocker box. Special tools and ECM tuning are required.

STAGE III
STAGE I + CAMS, BIG BORE CYLINDERS & PISTONS
The next step on the performance journey is to build a bigger engine. An increase in engine displacement allows the engine to swallow more air and fuel, a higher compression piston squeezes the air/fuel into a more volatile mixture, and when combined, generates more power when ignited. A displacement and compression increase provides torque increases throughout the entire RPM range with a 15-25% improvement in the mid-range power. ECM calibration tuning is required to adjust fuel flow and timing to accommodate the increased displacement.

Stage III bolt-on upgrade requires removal of the engine's top-end and opening the cam chest. Engine remains in the chassis and no machining is required. Special tools and ECM tuning are required.

STAGE IV
SCREAMIN' EAGLE
STAGE I + CAMS, BIG BORE CYLINDERS, PISTONS, CYLINDER HEADS & THROTTLE BODY
To maximize the impact of the increased displacement gained with Stage III updates, the addition of free-flowing ported cylinder heads and a big bore throttle body top off the performance build. Designed to satisfy the high RPM, throttle twisting rider, the Stage IV update delivers 20-30% increase in power that keeps pulling right up to the redline, without sacrificing mid-range torque. ECM calibration tuning is required to add more fuel, and a higher-lift cam may be required to deliver maximum power.
Stage IV bolt-on upgrade requires removal of the engine's top-end and opening the cam chest. Engine remains in the chassis and no machining is required. Special tools and ECM tuning are required.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE® HIGH-FLOW EXHAUST SYSTEM WITH STREET CANNON MUFFLERS The Screamin' Eagle® High-Flow Exhaust system provides bolt-on performance by reducing the catalyst restrictions and improving exhaust flow. This exhaust system is optimized for use on engines producing 80+ horsepower and works great with Screamin' Eagle Stage Kits. The kit replaces the stock head pipe and mufflers with large diameter, free-flowing head pipes and matching mufflers. The muffler inlet diameter has been increased to 2.25" to enhance exhaust gas scavenging and the catalysts have been relocated to the mufflers to enhance flow. The proof is in the horsepower and torque numbers. Dial the system to your motorcycle by using the Screamin' Eagle Pro Street Tuner to tune your ECM specifically to match your performance upgrades.
The large 4" diameter Street Cannon mufflers are tuned to provide a deep bass exhaust note and a healthy rumble at idle, and that famous Harley sound throughout the RPM range. 50-State U.S. EPA compliant. Fits '10-'16 Touring models (except CVOTM). Does not fit Trike models. Separate purchase of Screamin' Eagle 4" endcaps required. All models require ECM calibration for proper installation.

TWIN CAM STAGE II UPGRADE
Camshafts are a fundamental ingredient in the performance recipe, because they control the timing and duration of all major engine events. They are the primary means by which you can tune your engine's horsepower and torque output. Every cam has unique lift and overlap performance characteristics, which means you need to select cams based on exactly the kind of power you're looking for.

SE-255 CAM KIT The ultimate in torque cams, this cam offers substantial increase in low end torque for engines up to 110 cubic inches with compression ratios up to 10 to 1. The low end torque increases are great for heavy bikes or for the person who routinely shifts below 4500 RPM and wants the power available to pass without downshifting. The cam still makes peak power above 5000 RPM so people with lighter bikes will enjoy the torque increases without feeling like the bike runs out of air at higher engine speeds. 50-State U.S. EPA compliant.
25638-07 $329.95 For use on '09-'13 Dyna®, Softail®, and '09-'13 Touring and Trike models with 103CI and 110CI engines. All models require ECM calibration for proper installation. Labor cost not included. See Dealer for details.

BOLT-ON BIG BORE CYLINDERS
In the past, the only way to increase the bore of your 103 or 110 cubic inch Twin Cam V-Twin motor was to tear down the motor and re-bore the engine cases to fit larger bore cylinder spigots. It was a labor-intensive and expensive process. The Screamin' Eagle team has engineered a 4" Big Bore Cylinder and Piston package that increase the internal bore from 3-7/8" to 4", without increasing the outside diameter of the cylinder spigot. The cylinder slips into the existing case bore without modification.

SPORTSTER POWERTRAIN
Screamin' Eagle® Stage upgrades offer complete street-compliant performance configurations engineered to generate specific torque and horsepower gains. Eliminating all the guesswork and trial-and-error testing normally associated with engine modifications, Stage upgrades include everything you need to enhance your bike's performance. You can start with key components that give you a bump in power right now, add components as time and budget permits, or you can go for it all at once.

STAGE I
INTAKE + EXHAUST + TUNING
The easiest and most cost effective step to improve your motorcycle's performance is to increase the air flow into and out of the engine. A high-flow air cleaner and system-matched slip-on mufflers provide horsepower and torque improvements you can feel throughout the RPM range, and serve as the core components for all performance upgrades. ECM calibration is required to tune the fuel flow and timing required to accommodate the improved air flow.
Stage I upgrade can be installed without engine disassembly. No special tools are required. Requires ECM tuning.

STAGE II
STAGE I + CAM UPGRADE
Adding performance cams to a Stage I equipped bike is the next step to improved performance. Cam choices allow you to tailor the engine's performance to your specific needs. A torque cam offers on-demand throttle response from low- to mid-RPM at cruising speed. A power cam targets high-rpm, wide-open throttle response that keeps pulling right up to redline. ECM calibration tuning is required to accommodate the increased valve timing, and performance valve springs may be required for highlift cams.

STAGE IV
STAGE I + CAMS, PISTONS, CYLINDER HEADS & THROTTLE BODY
For maximum performance improvement, the addition of high-compression pistons, free-flowing ported cylinder heads and a big bore throttle body top off a performance build. The large diameter throttle body and port-matched intake manifold deliver huge volumes of fuel and air to the engine, the smooth passages and larger valves easily dump the mixture into the engine, and the high compression pistons squeeze the air/fuel into a more volatile vapor. When ignited, the result is a major power increase. Designed to satisfy the high RPM, throttle twisting rider, the Stage IV update delivers 20-30% increase in power that keeps pulling right up to the redline, without sacrificing mid-range torque. ECM calibration tuning is required to add more fuel, and a higher-lift cam may be required to deliver maximum power.

NOTE: Due to increased diameter of these mufflers some realignment of head pipes is usually required. It is recommended to replace exhaust port gaskets, P/N 65324-83A (stock) or P/N 17048-98 (performance), to avoid tendency of head pipes to return to original position when re-tightened. NOTE: There is no warranty on exhaust pipes and mufflers with regard to any discoloration. Blueing is caused by tuning characteristics, cam timing, carburetor jetting, over-heating, etc. and is not caused by defective manufacturing.

F. SCREAMIN' EAGLE VARIABLE PRESSURE CLUTCH 2 Get more performance from the Original Equipment clutch. The Screamin' Eagle® Variable Pressure Clutch is designed to help put the added power from a Screamin' Eagle Stage Kit to the pavement. This bolt-on kit harnesses the centrifugal force of spinning weights to increase the clutch capacity as engine speed increases. The mechanism applies increasing pressure to the stock clutch pressure plate as RPM rises. The result: High torque-handling capabilities without increasing clutch lever effort at idle. The Variable Pressure Clutch also provides smoother clutch disengagement at lower speed. Kit fits behind most stock derby covers with no modifications. See installation manual for additional accessory derby cover fitment information.
To match the performance demands of your engine, team the Variable Pressure Clutch with your choice of clutch diaphragm springs. We recommend the higher capacity Screamin' Eagle Diaphragm Spring P/N 37951-98 for major performance upgrades.

E. SCREAMIN' EAGLE PERFORMANCE 2 SLIPPER CLUTCH FOR VRSCTM MODELS This clutch offers reduced lever effort and improved performance. The unique "slip and assist" ramp system opens the two halves of the clutch hub slightly during high loads to the drivetrain, allowing a moderate slip that reduces shock to the drivetrain during rapid downshifting. The resulting reduction in wheel hop allows maximum contact between the tire and the road in wet or slippery conditions. Clutch lever effort is also reduced by 20% in 1130cc and 30% on 1250cc applications.

6-Speed Transmission
F. SCREAMIN' EAGLE® 6-SPEED 2 TRANSMISSION AND GEAR SET Designed from the ground up, the Screamin' Eagle® transmission incorporates many of the best Original Equipment features, like a late-style shifting mechanism and a newly designed "shift ring" system to make this the smoothest shifting Harley-Davidson® transmission available. The "shift ring" system is similar to the system used in the VRSCTM transmission and it slides on the shafts to mate into the gears. This eliminates sliding heavy gears to accomplish the shift and results in smooth, precise and light effort shifting. Sixth gear is a true overdrive, at a .89:1 ratio and the first five gears mimic today's proven 5-speed ratios. The overdrive feature allows you to run a lower engine RPM in sixth gear, at any given road speed. Lower RPM can result in lower vibration, longer engine life and smoother cruising. The Screamin' Eagle 6-Speed Transmission is available as a complete transmission or as a replacement gear set and can be matched with hydraulic or cable-operated clutch controls.
Screamin' Eagle 6-Speed Transmissions feature forged chrome "trap door," forged shifter forks and forged and precisely ground gears. No speedometer or exhaust mount modifications are required. Complete transmissions are ready to install into the chassis and the 6-Speed Gear Set Kits are designed to replace the stock gear set without removing the transmission. Gear Set Kits require slight modification (template included) to the Original Equipment transmission case and include all necessary installation hardware.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON LONGBLOCK PROGRAM
®

Your engine is the heart and soul of your Harley-Davidson® motorcycle. When the miles start to add up, a Harley-Davidson LongBlock can put the rumble back in your ride simply, quickly, and affordably.
WHY SHOULD I CONSIDER A LONGBLOCK? Unlike an

engine rebuild from the repair shop down the street, the Harley-Davidson® LongBlock is manufactured from 100% new Original Equipment components, and is built to the latest factory specifications. Engine includes upgraded Screamin' Eagle® lefty crankcase bearing, Screamin' Eagle® o cam bearings and Screamin' Eagle performance tappets to handle higher stress loads and performance upgrades. In l addition, '99-'06 LongBlocks are upgraded with late-model hydraulic cam tensioners, high-volume oil pump and billet cam plate. '07-'16 103CI and 110CI engines feature factory-installed Automatic Compression Releases.
WHAT DOES THE H-D® LONGBLOCK INCLUDE? The crankcase se

s, is pre-assembled with flywheels, connecting rods, bearings, , seals, cylinders, pistons, rings, heads, valves, valve springs, tappets and pushrod covers. Also included and ready for r Dealer installation are top end rocker arm supports, rocker arms and shafts, pushrods, and breathers. The LongBlock also includes cam support plate, cam plate bearings, cam d and timing chain drive, hydraulic tensioners and all required gaskets and new hardware.
ARE UPGRADES AVAILABLE?* You can choose silver or

black-highlighted engines to match your styling direction. Bikes originally equipped with Twin Cam 88® engines can upgrade to 95 or 103CI displacement, and Twin Cam I 96TM-equipped models can be repowered with 103 or 110CI re engines, based on specific model fitment. Upgrades require model-specific ECM recalibration (sold separately). Only available in North America.
WHAT ELSE DO I NEED? LongBlock is sold without cam

shafts, lower rocker boxes, upper rocker box covers, or cam cover. You have the option to re-install your current cams and covers, or select from a wide assortment of performance and custom engine cover options.

One of the easiest ways to personalize your bike is by layering on elements from a well-chosen custom collection.

Start by selecting a collection that matches your style, and then determine how far you want to go.

COMPLETE THE LOOK
Whether it's flames, skulls or classic chrome, installing a collection draws the eye from one end of the bike to the other. So, add them in steps or all at once ­ for a big visual impact. 3 1

The most visual contact point you have with your motorcycle is where your hands and feet meet the controls. Choose a handlebar suitable for your physical needs. Then select grips, hand controls, footpegs and mirrors to underscore the style of your ride.

698 CONTROLS

TOUC H PO I N TS
From a rider's perspective, the controls are one of the most visual parts of the bike. They are the first thing you touch when you drop into the saddle, and what you see every mile you ride. That makes your controls a prime candidate for special treatment. Styled to put an integrated look just a few wrench turns away, installing one of our hand and foot control collections is a solid first step to an all-out custom journey.

BRASS COLLECTION The authentic alternative to the typical chrome-covered or blacked-out look, the Harley-Davidson ® Brass Collection delivers a warm, hand-crafted look to your custom ride. These minimalistic living finish components make a garage-built styling statement and are the ideal addition to your strippeddown bobber or café motorcycle.

HEATED HAND GRIPS Keep comfortable on those cool mornings or frigid night rides. Warm hands have a major impact on overall body comfort and sometimes gloves just aren't enough.

With both hands on the grips, they will remain at a constant temperature regardless of changes in outside temperature. The selfcontained control circuit and control knob means you have no additional switches or controller boxes to mount and the grips are switched on/off with the ignition to avoid draining your battery. The glueless grip design allows grip removal if you change handlebars or motorcycles. A. HEATED HAND GRIPS ­ AIRFLOW Wrap your fingers around the chrome ridge for a sweet tactile feel. These grips combine a traction-grip crosshatch rubber surface with a comfortable 1.6" diameter for excellent control in wet or dry weather.

The flash of chrome. It's the first thing that everyone sees. And the one thing that everyone remembers. Dressing your bike's hand controls in chrome is one of the first steps in building a complete custom ride. After all, the hand controls are the one visual and physical connection you have with your bike every minute you are in the saddle. Harley-Davidson offers all the components you need to make the custom conversion.

INSTANT GR ATI F IC ATION
Combining chrome and custom replacement parts creates a truly unique look and feel. A chrome master cylinder kit, a set of chrome switch housings, custom hand grips and braided control cables finish the custom installation.

C OM FO R T, ST YLE OR BOTH ?
Every person is unique. Your overall height, arm reach, upper body length and riding style all dictate your relationship to the bike's controls. Add in the desire for a unique, custom look and your handlebar options multiply exponentially.*

YOUR RIDING POSITION

DR AG HA NDLEBAR *
Narrow, flat and more aggressive, drag bars provide a straight elbow and neutral hand and wrist position. For maximum comfort, drag bars can be positioned with curved or straight risers to minimize stretch to the controls.

BEACH HA NDLEBAR *
Low and wide, a beach bar spreads your arms and gives you room to breathe. Ideal for the rider with long arms, beach bars can be a little too wide for many riders. While selecting a bar, make sure you can reach the hand controls when the handlebar is fully turned.

APE HA NGER & TA LLBOY® HANDLEBAR *
Tall and wide, ape hanger and Tallboy® handlebars provide a classic "fists-in-the-wind" look and can add long-haul comfort for riders with long arms. Because handlebar height is regulated in many areas, check local laws before installing a tall handlebar.

CHI Z ELED HA NDL EBAR*
For cutting edge style, a Chizeled Bar combines the hands-up feel of a mini-ape with the narrow width of a drag bar. The bar's shoulder-width design keeps the elbows in and the arms straight ahead, and the wrist and hands fall in a neutral palms-down grip.

CHOOSING YOUR HANDLEBAR
RISE is the vertical distance between a handlebar's tip and its base. Adding risers to bars that sit too low can help put hand grips into your sweet spot. PULL BACK is the distance the handlebar tips come back toward the rider. Greater pull back can eliminate the long reach to the bar for a shorter rider. WIDTH is measured from tip-to-tip. Make sure the bar isn't too wide so it pulls your hands off the grips when turning. KNURL CENTER is the distance between the center line of the bar's knurling. The measurement should match the riser dimension to maximize clamping pressure. *NOTE: Installation of some handlebars and risers may require a change in clutch and/or throttle cable and brake lines for some models. Handlebar height is regulated in many areas. Check local laws before installation. **1.25" Fat Bar base necks down to fit 1.0" handlebar clamp.

A. EXTREME REACH® HANDLEBAR* Extensively tested with a panel of riders between 5'-0" to 5'-5" tall, this Extreme Reach® Handlebar and recommended riser combination was proven to be the most ergonomically pleasing handlebar for many Dyna® and Softail® models. Shaped to provide the ideal balance of pull back and width, this handlebar produces an overall pull back of 11.0" and a tip-to-tip width of 30.0" when combined with Curved Riser Kit P/N 56266-09 (sold separately). Your hands fall naturally in place and the narrow width reduces your stretch while making low-speed turns and parking lot maneuvers.

The narrower width reduces your stretch while making low-speed turns and parking lot maneuvers, and the overall effect is improved confidence and long-range comfort for short-armed riders.

CHOOSE YOUR BATWING HANDLEBAR Just about every model of Harley-Davidson® motorcycle features a different stock handlebar. Selected to complement the style or use of the bike, the handlebar may be the ideal shape for many riders, but of course, not everyone has the same physical characteristics.
Choosing a bar for your batwing fairing-equipped model is about more than just style ­ it's about how you approach the road. Where the bar positions your hands, wrists, and arms directly affects how you feel on your motorcycle. For every set of bars, there are three factors at work: rise, pullback and width. These three measurements determine your reach to the hand controls and, therefore your overall feeling of comfort and control.

A. ROAD GLIDE® CHIZELED LO HANDLEBAR* With a low 9.0" rise and a flat drag-bar hand position, this compact Z bar will place the rider into an aggressive, tuckedin riding posture.

The 1.25" Chizeled Bar replaces mitered and welded corners with cast seamless 90° bends for added strength and style. The cast elbows eliminate sharp internal bends and the bar features removable Bar & Shield plugs to simplify internal wiring. Bars are available in brilliant chrome or gloss black finishes to match your bike's custom direction.

HA N DLE BAR R I S E RS
You may think you are perfectly happy with the way your bike is adjusted. But that doesn't mean that it is correctly set up for you. We get used to our bikes -- our muscles become trained and we end up accommodating the bike. It is far better to take the time to make the bike accommodate you. If you are satisfied with your handlebar's width and wrist position, but wish it was just a little higher, lower or closer to you, your dealer can recommend a set of handlebar risers that move the bar into your comfort zone.

ADJUSTING YOUR HAND POSITION

ST O CK H A NDL EBA R
Just about every model of Harley-Davidson® motorcycle comes with a different stock handlebar. Selected to complement the style of the bike, the handlebar may be the ideal shape for many riders, but of course, not everyone has the same physical characteristics.

ST O CK HANDLEBA R WITH RISERS
If the stock handlebar has the correct width and hand position for you, but seems just a little too far away, we offer riser kits that bring the controls within reach. Straight and curved risers are available for many model and handlebar combinations.

Harley-Davidson ® Boom! TM Audio is an exciting collection of integrated audio components designed to combine the maximum number of features with an easy-to-use interface. And because your bike's Original Equipment radio is designed for plug-and-play integration of Boom! Audio equipment, you can easily create the custom sound experience you've always wanted.

Our goal is to deliver exceptional products that create a deep emotional connection between music and riding. We don't take the easy way out by assuming that louder is better. Instead, we find ways to optimize bass while keeping distortion low. Our audio specialists work hand in hand with our vehicle engineers to optimize speaker enclosures and locations for both the standard and Boom! Audio speakers. Boom! Audio systems are designed to be loud enough to cut through road noise without sacrificing accurate sound reproduction. All you hear is musical balance and clarity. Each combination of speakers relies on a unique equalization curve programmed into the amplifier to maximize the system's performance. This gives Boom! Audio a clear advantage over other aftermarket systems.

Neo magnets are light, small and very powerful. They are roughly 10 times stronger than equivalent ferrite magnets, so neo magnets achieve the same strength with one-tenth the size and weight of traditional magnets. 1

D EC I D E HOW FAR YOU WAN T TO GO

Equipping your bike with a concert-quality sound-system is not as difficult as you would think. Follow these three simple steps to determine how you want your bike equipped, and then select which Boom! TM Audio speaker system matches your needs.

STEP 1

REPL ACE THE FACTORY SPE AKERS
The first step toward audio perfection is to replace the Original Equipment speakers with your choice of Boom! Audio speakers and matching amplifier(s). The larger bass and separate mid/high range speaker components deliver increased musical accuracy, and the added power helps cut through the wind and road noise. 4-speaker Stage I systems require one Boom! Audio amplifier, and bi-amplified Stage II systems are powered by two dedicated amplifiers.

STEP 2

3

ADD SPE AKERS & AMPS
Now we are getting serious. Adding a 3rd pair of Boom! Audio speakers and an additional amplifier delivers the extra punch that only a "wall of sound" can provide. Adding a third set of speakers in the saddlebag lids or in the fairing lowers directs more sound to the motorcycle's cockpit, building depth and presence to the musical experience. 6-speaker Stage I systems are powered by two Boom! Audio amplifiers, and bi-amplified Stage II systems require three dedicated amplifiers.

STEP 3

BUILD THE ULTIMATE SYSTEM
This is the complete package. Rounding out the system with a fourth set of speakers adds enhanced bass punch and a weighty sound sure to grab attention. The 8-speaker "surround sound" effect puts the rider and passenger inside an envelope of sound for a road-tripping musical experience like no other. 8-speaker Stage I systems are powered by two Boom! Audio amplifiers, and bi-amplified Stage II systems require four dedicated amplifiers.

776 AUDIO & GAUGES

STAG E II BOOM ! TM AU D I O SYS T E MS
Boom!TM Audio Stage II systems give you the very best motorcycle sound experience. Stage II systems are based on a bi-amplified, three-way speaker design. Each Stage II speaker features a separate woofer, mid-range and tweeter element that allow frequencies to be delivered with the optimum driver design. Each speaker is powered by two channels from the amplifier -- one for the woofer, and the second for the mid-range/tweeter combination -- for a total output of 150 watts/speaker. This doubling of the power allows you to play your music louder with far less distortion than traditional systems.

Boom!TM Audio ­ Stage II
BOOM!TM AUDIO STAGE II COMPONENTS* Headline your own concert tour. Big and bold is the best way to describe the musical performance you will experience when listening to your favorite band through a Boom!TM Audio Stage II sound system. The weather-proof 3-way speakers feature high-excursion woofers for extended bass performance, and separate mid- and high-frequency drivers for rich vocals and startlingly real treble notes. Powered by a dedicated 300 watt RMS amplifier, each pair of speakers is capable of producing "filling-rattling" volume. Designed to work seamlessly with the factory installed Boom! Audio infotainment head unit, the Boom! Stage II components are system matched and feature custom tuned static and dynamic equalization that dial in the ideal setup for your ride. And you can choose how far you want to go. From a single pair of fairing mounted speakers and a 300 watt amp to a full bore 8 speaker, 4 amp, 1200 watt system, we've got you covered. A. BOOM! AUDIO AMPLIFIER KIT Take your music to the streets. Boom!TM Audio Amplifier Kits allow you to crank up the volume with significantly less distortion. The amplifier provides more power than Original Equipment radio alone, resulting in increased volume, fuller sound reproduction, reduced clipping and lower Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Unlike aftermarket amplifiers that connect between the radio and the speakers, the Boom! Audio amplifier bypasses the radio's internal power amp to produce the cleanest sound possible. The Boom! Audio Amplifier boosts the pure source signal, minimizing any distortion generated through the speaker output. The system-matched high-output signal features optimized sound equalization for crisp, clear vocals and maximum bass response and the strong midrange response cuts through wind and road noise. The waterproof 4-channel, 75-watts RMS/channel amplifier (300-watt RMS total) has been designed from the groundup for the harsh motorcycle environment. Fairing Mounted kit includes all mounting hardware and wiring harness. Note: The use of the Boom! Audio Amplifier turns off the radio's internal amplifier. 76000278 Fairing Mounted. $599.95 Fits '14-later Electra Glide®, Street Glide®, Ultra Limited and ® Tri Glide models equipped with a Boom! Box audio system. Dealer Digital TechnicianTM software update is required. Dealer installation is recommended.

Boom!TM Audio Stage I systems take your sound to the next level. When compared to the factory installed Original Equipment audio system, Boom! Audio Stage I speakers feature larger woofers for deeper bass and soft-dome tweeters for better balanced sound quality. Efficient Stage I speakers can be easily powered with the built-in amplifier in the factory-installed Boom Box Infotainment System, or with the addition of Boom!TM Audio amplifiers, the larger speakers can produce more volume at all frequencies. A custom EQ was developed for each configuration of speakers to get the most out of the Stage I system.

A. BOOM!TM AUDIO AMPLIFIER KIT Take your music to the streets. Boom!TM Audio Amplifier Kits allow you to crank up the volume with significantly less distortion. The amplifier provides more power than Original Equipment radio alone, resulting in increased volume, fuller sound reproduction, reduced clipping and lower Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) than head unit alone. Unlike aftermarket amplifiers that connect between the radio and the speakers, the Boom! Audio amplifier bypasses the radio's internal power amp to produce the cleanest sound possible. The Boom! Audio Amplifier boosts the pure source signal, minimizing any distortion generated through the speaker output. The system-matched high-output signal features optimized sound equalization for crisp, clear vocals and maximum bass response and the strong midrange response cuts through wind and road noise. The waterproof 4-channel, 75-watts/channel amplifier (300-watt total) has been designed from the ground-up for the harsh motorcycle environment. Fairing Mounted kit includes all mounting hardware and wiring harness. Note: The use of the Boom! Audio Amplifier turns off the radio's internal amplifier. 76000278 Fairing Mounted. $599.95 Fits '14-later Electra Glide®, Street Glide®, Ultra Limited and Tri Glide® models equipped with a Boom!

NO N E E D TO S HOUT
Riding alone is a good way to unwind and clear your head. But if you've got a passenger, or you're riding with a group, inevitably you'll need to communicate with others. A tap on the helmet, a hand signal or frantic waves only get you so far. Welcome to Boom!TM Audio wireless Bluetooth® technology.

Boom! Audio Bluetooth headsets allow riders and passengers to connect on the open road. These comfortable headsets permit a number of riders to pair into the network and "rebroadcast" signals up and down the line to extend the effective range. In addition to driver-to-rider intercom and bike-to-bike communication, these wireless headsets let you connect to cell phones, GPS devices, and personal music players.

A. DAYMAKERTM SIGNATURE REFLECTOR LED HEADLAMP Surrounded by a glowing halo of light, these DaymakerTM Signature Reflector LED Lamps offer superior nighttime performance while making a bold visual statement. These brilliant LED lamps produce a bright-white beam that lights up the surroundings and draws the attention of oncoming traffic. The natural daylight lamp color is easy on your eyes and is tuned to enhance and amplify the reflective character of highway signs and lane markers. The efficient LED elements are hidden behind the lamp's stylish center crossbar, and project their brilliant light onto the optically-tuned reflector bowls for a focused beam of light. The always-on low-beam produces a wide pool of general lighting, and the high-beam adds focused light to add punch down the middle of the lane. The long-life solid-state LED lamps are housed in weather-sealed shock and vibration-resistant lamp assemblies. Installation is simple, and the plug-in lamps require no splicing. Meets DOT and ECE standards.

Make a definitive style statement. Whether you're going for an old-school or new-school look, this is where you set the tone. You'll ride comfortably knowing that Harley-Davidson® wheels meet the highest standards of performance and durability.

882 WHEELS

STR E NGT H & ST YLE
From a visual perspective, the wheels, sprocket and brake rotors make up almost half of the motorcycle's profile, and they set the styling direction for the whole bike. Choose wisely. Harley-Davidson® custom wheels undergo thousands of hours of real-world testing to meet the highest standards of performance and durability.

TURBINE POLISHED FLOATING BRAKE ROTORS

WHEELS 883

WH E E L F I N I S H OPT I ON S
SELECT A FINISH TO MATCH YOUR ST YLE

MIRROR CHROME
Looking for the ultimate flash? Choose Mirror Chrome wheels. To achieve this rich look, our dedicated team of polishers spends hours preparing the wheel for its finish. All visible wheel surfaces are micro-polished to a glass smooth finish, and special masking is applied to prevent contamination to threads and bearing bores.

CONT RAST CHROME
Can't make up your mind? Choose Contrast Chrome wheels. We start with a hand polished wheel, and add a proprietary finish that features both gloss black paint and chrome highlights. The combination produces a stunning contrast that lightens the wheel's profile by visually thinning the spokes, rim and hub.

GLO SS BL ACK
Want a sinister look? Choose Gloss Black. First, we polish all the surfaces. Then we apply the rich coating for a finish with incredible depth and shimmer. The all-black spoke and rim blend with the tire sidewall to deliver a massive profile on a blacked-out bike, but the deep gloss surface holds its own in the company of chrome.

WH EEL CA RE
The road provides plenty of nasty elements that can be potentially damaging to the finish of motorcycle wheels. Harley® Wheel & Tire Cleaner safely removes brake dust and road grime from wheels, tires and whitewalls in seconds. Just wet the wheel, spray on Wheel & Tire Cleaner, work it into tight areas with a Spoke Brush, and rinse away the dirt.

WHEEL ORDERING PROCESS STEP ONE
Select a wheel part number for your specific fitment.

STEP TWO
Select the wheel installation kit for your specific application (model, year, and front or rear). Note: If your model is not specified in the wheel fitment, a wheel installation kit will not make the wheel fit your model.

STEP THREE
Refer to the instruction sheet included in your wheel kit to determine the necessary parts required from the installation kit.

STEP FOUR
Use only Harley-Davidson specified tires. See a Harley-Davidson® dealer. Using non-specified tires can adversely affect stability, handling or braking, which could result in death or serious injury.

B. COLOR-MATCHED ROAD GLIDE® HEADLAMP TRIM This sleek one-piece headlamp surround adds a clean custom look to the nose of the Road Glide ® model. The easy-toinstall Headlamp Trim hugs the dual headlamps, and covers the matte black factory bezel for a menacing aerodynamic appearance. The swept back look and the knife-edge side strakes emphasize the streamlined shape of the fairing without impeding air flow to the vents or obstructing headlamp light patterns. Available in your choice of finish, the self-adhesive Headlamp Trim can be installed without removing the headlamp or fairing.
Fits '15-later Road Glide models.

A. CUSTOM WRAPPED FRONT FENDER Give your bike a big hug. This all-steel fender is shaped to show off the full profile of your 19" front wheel. The apronless fender wraps almost 180 degrees around the front tire for a clean, custom appearance, and the low profile cutaway design exposes the wheel from hub to rim for maximum visual impact. Designed for mistake-proof installation, the fender is pre-drilled to fit Original Equipment fender mounting bosses, and does not require additional fender spacers or install kits. Available in Color-Matched, Vivid Black or primed and readyto-paint finish.
Fits '14-later Touring models equipped with 17", 18" or 19" wheel and tire combination. Does not fit with Fender Tip Assembly P/N 59600003 or 59600006. Does not fit Trike models.

B. CUSTOM STRETCHED SIDE COVERS Add a long, lean look to the profile of your Touring bike. These Stretched Side Covers are sculpted to smooth the visual transition from the side of the bike to the front of the saddlebag, and trade the traditional stepped look for a rearward flowing design. Shaped to flare out and down the saddlebag face, the sleek side covers complement the body lines and eliminate the saddlebag guard clearance notch at the lower corner for a seamless flow. And unlike some aftermarket designs, these side covers fit without significantly compromising the available passenger foot space. The one-piece covers are a snapin replacement for the Original Equipment covers, and require no bonding or modification for installation. Available in ColorMatched, Vivid Black or primed and ready-to-paint finish.
Fits '14-later Touring models. Does not fit with Auxiliary Power Port P/N 69201099.

Café Custom Accessories
A. COLOR-MATCHED CAFÉ CUSTOM TAIL SECTION Create your own link to the Sportster®-based racing and performance bikes of the '60s and '70s. This fast-back solo seat and tail section mirrors the look and feel of the iconic 1977-78 Harley-Davidson ® XLCR Café Racer model, and re-imagines the style for the modern era. Ideal for use with Clip-On or Sportster Clubman Handlebars and mid- or rear-set foot controls, this seat provides the perfect lay-down aggressive riding posture for splitting lanes or carving corners. The seat's upturned tail and longer nose positions the solo rider closer to the tank for better weight balance, quicker steering and added front-end feedback. The Tail Section is a true bolton design that wraps the fender struts, so unlike other café bike kits, there is no cutting, welding or frame modifications required. Installation is reversible ­ you can return easily your bike to the stock look. The complete kit features a sweeping composite tail section with a steel inner support, a deep solo bucket seat with backstop pad, and all necessary installation hardware.
Fits '10-later XL883N, XL1200CX, XL1200N, XL1200V and XL1200X models. Separate purchase of License Plate Bracket Kit P/N 67900360 for Canada models or P/N 67900359 for HDI models is required.

MORE THAN AN OIL CHANGE
Maintaining your Harley® motorcycle can be almost as enjoyable as riding it. The hours spent in the driveway inspecting every part and every surface keeps you in touch with the bike. But when it comes to major service, remember that your Harley-Davidson® dealership's technicians are specially trained to properly diagnose and maintain your bike. Whether it's your first 1,000-mile checkup or a 20,000-mile service, a Harley-Davidson dealership should be your destination. THE WELL-EQUIPPED GARAGE Adventure comes at a price. As mileage adds up, moisture, dust and road debris can take their toll on the bike's wear-prone surfaces. But, if you have the right tools for fighting through miles and miles of the highway's abuse, you'll be more than ready to keep your bike in top running condition.
MAINTENANCE
Keeping your bike road-ready takes a special touch. Topping off the fluids, checking the tire pressure, and keeping the battery fully charged are no problem when you have the right Harley-Davidson maintenance tools in your garage.

FLUIDS
Whether it's oil, brake fluid or Screamin' Eagle® SYN3® Synthetic Motorcycle Lubricant, all Harley-Davidson fluids are developed exclusively for use in HarleyDavidson motorcycles, making them a must-have in your garage.

BATTERIES
Genuine H-D ® Batteries are engineered for the harsh motorcycle environment, and feature AGM technology for higher cold cranking amps, longer life and improved rechargeability.

TIRES TOOLS
Every bit as rugged as our motorcycles, Harley-Davidson tools and tool kits boast a compact, lightweight design developed specifically for use on your Harley® motorcycle.

FILTERS
Don't overlook the essentials. Harley-Davidson air and oil filters keep debris out of your engine to help keep it healthy. So replace them routinely and insist on using only the Genuine article.

Harley-Davidson co-branded Dunlop® and Michelin® tires are ready to go the distance. Extensively tested in real-world conditions, our recommended tires are engineered for long life, comfortable ride and competent handling.

A. TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE AND FILL VALVE Simplify checking the air pressure level and filling the tires on your motorcycle. This Tire Pressure Gauge features an 18" flexible hose and 2-way air chuck with both a 45° fill port and a unique side fill port that provides easy straight-in access to hard-to-reach motorcycle valve stems. The dual-range instantread gauge measures pressures from 0-60 psi and 0-400 kPa, and is protected from impact and abrasion by a thick rubber collar. Designed to fit an air compressor with a standard 1/4" quick-disconnect coupler, this gauge allows you to check the pressure and fill the tire without removing the chuck from the tire. Just apply the chuck to the valve stem, read the pressure, and add air by depressing the comfortable trigger leaver. And for checking tire pressure on the road, you can use this tool like any standard tire gauge.

B. COMPACT AIR COMPRESSOR WITH LIGHT Correct tire pressure is crucial to safe operation and long tire life, but checking the pressure, finding a gas station with a working air pump, and filling the tire is a chore that many of us ignore. The Compact Air Compressor is designed to simplify this necessary procedure. The compact, lightweight 12V pump is designed for life on the road. The all-in-one pump plugs into your bike's battery charging harness, and features a built-in 0-160 psi pressure gauge and bright LED work light. The 11" air hose and 6' fuse-protected power cord easily reach the front and rear wheels, and are stored in convenient compartments when not in use. The lightweight pump features durable, impact-resistant construction, and is small enough to fit easily in a saddlebag or strap-on luggage. Kit includes pump, valve stem extension, and nylon carrying bag.

Simply screw the extension in place on the stem, fill the tire to the proper pressure, remove the extension, and replace the valve stem cap. Then toss the extension in your saddlebag or tool roll for the next time.

BODYGUARD IN A BOTTLE
Oil is the lifeblood of your engine. It not only lubricates the moving parts, it cools, cleans, and flushes away all the byproducts of combustion. It lives in an environment filled with heat, friction, and toxins that are determined to break it down and shorten its useful life. And it keeps the heart of your motorcycle beating at idle or at full speed. Harley-Davidson's complete line of lubricants are formulated specifically to keep your motorcycle running strong, mile after mile.

ENGINE OIL FAQ'S

What's in a bottle of oil? · The Base Stock makes up 75-80% of a bottle of oil. Generally, if it comes from the ground, it is a Mineral Oil. And if it is made in a lab or a reactor, it is Synthetic Oil. · The Additive Pack of ingredients that make oil smarter and better tailored to the application. The additives include: ­ Viscosity Modifiers ­ lets oil flow like 20 weight oil at start-up and 50 weight oil at operating temperatures ­ Detergents ­ cleans inside your engine ­ Dispersants ­ suspends contaminants in the oil so they can be carried to the filter ­ Buffers ­ neutralizes acids that form in your engine ­ Anti-oxidants ­ prevents sludge and oil thickening oxidation ­ Corrosion inhibitors ­ protects internal components from corroding ­ Anti-wear additives ­ provides protection against internal wear How often should I change my motorcycle engine oil? You should change your motorcycle engine oil and engine oil filter at the first 1,000-mile service interval and at every 5,000-mile service interval thereafter. If you ride your motorcycle hard, under dusty conditions, or in cold weather, the engine oil and filter should be changed more often. You should always change your engine oil and filter prior to winter storage (or any extended storage) so that your engine oil is clean and free of contaminants during this time period. What viscosity grade should I use in my Harley Motorcycle? The recommended viscosity grade for all temperature conditions is SAE 20W50 Harley-Davidson® Motor Oil. The SAE 50 H-D® Motorcycle Oil is satisfactory in ambient temperatures of 60-80°F, and the SAE 60 H-D Motorcycle Oil in ambient temperatures above 80°F. SAE 20W50 covers the broadest range of operating temperatures.

What's the difference between synthetic and petroleum-based lubricants? Group I, II and III petroleum-based lubricants are derived from oil pumped from the ground. Group IV and V synthetic lubricants are chemically produced in a lab. Petroleum-based lubricants inherit physical components (including contaminants) of the source crude oil in the refining process, while synthetic lubricants are custom-formulated to have desired properties for specific purposes, meaning that engineers have complete control of the lubricant from start to finish ­ at the molecular level. What's better in my bike ­ Petroleum or Synthetic? Petroleum lubricants have been around for a long time, and are effective at lubricating in most conditions, but mineral oil can't compete with the purity of synthetic lubricants--especially in extreme conditions. Synthetic oil does a better job reducing wear and resisting breakdown under a wider range of operating temperatures. What does SYN3® full Synthetic Motorcycle Lubricant do for my drivetrain? SYN3 ® Full Synthetic Motorcycle Lubricant offers all the benefits of Genuine Harley-Davidson ® 360 Motorcycle Oil, and:

What makes Harley SYN3 better than other Synthetics for my Harley? SYN3 is pure, genuine, full synthetic lubricant. · SYN3 base stocks are synthesized materials including Poly Alfa Olefin (PAO) and Esther, which are the most pure, highest quality synthetic base stocks available · SYN3 has the smartest, most robust additive package developed specifically to provide maximum performance and protection in H-D powertrains Beware...not all synthetics are created equal. · Due to a legal loophole, other brands are selling "Highly Refined Group III" mineral oil as synthetic oil · Head to head, SYN3 outperforms these oils SYN3 is a product you can trust, from a brand you can trust. Oil is the lifeblood to your Harley-Davidson; don't take chances with anything else. Why should I use H-D oil in my Harley? · No one tests as much as we do ­ we test on the road, on dynos, and in the laboratory · We accumulate millions of testing miles on our engines and drive trains, using only H-D Oil · We test in the harshest environments ­ testing is performed in the extreme heat of the desert · We test under the most rigorous duty cycles ­ accelerated durability testing helps explore the limits of our designs, in less time. This is a worst case scenario for oil · We run thousands of hours on dynos · We test in the laboratory ­ sampling and analyzing oil to determine its life and effectiveness during use H-D's additive package is the best available, it's the most robust, it was created exclusively for H-D powertrains, and we are the only ones who have it.

· Offers superior wear protection at higher temperatures · Keeps engines, transmissions and primary chaincases cleaner · Meets the anti-wear lubricity requirements of all transmission gears · Lubricates all primary chaincase components · Delivers smooth, sure clutch operation · Provides long-term protection of all internal components · Improves seal and gasket performance · Offers superior performance in high-output engines

ONE-YEAR OVER-THE-COUNTER PARTS AND ACCESSORIES WARRANTY
Harley-Davidson warrants that street legal Genuine Motor Parts ("Parts") and street legal Genuine Motor Accessories ("Accessories") that are purchased on or after January 1, 2012 through an authorized dealer will be free from factory defects, under normal use and service, for a period of one year starting from the date of retail sale and delivery (not date of installation). Because this limited warranty covers only Parts and Accessories, labor is not covered. This limited parts warranty does not cover defects or damage due to abuse, misuse or improper installation. This parts warranty applies to Parts and Accessories you or an aftermarket shop have installed, but only for defects in manufacturing -- not conditions caused by the improper installation. This Parts and Accessories warranty is separate and distinct from the limited factory warranty that applies to your stock motorcycle. This Parts and Accessories warranty does not extend or modify the factory warranty that applies to your motorcycle. It only covers the street legal Genuine Motor Parts and street legal Genuine Motor Accessories added to your motorcycle. This Parts and Accessories warranty does not cover defects, damage or premature wear to your motorcycle that are caused by the installation or use of Parts and Accessories, even those installed by an authorized dealership. Examples include, but are not limited to performanceenhancing powertrain components or software, exhaust systems, non-approved tires, lowering kits, handlebars, add-ons connected to the factory electrical system, etc. The fact that Parts or Accessories are labeled or branded Harley-Davidson, or are sold or installed by an authorized dealership, does not necessarily make them appropriate or warranted for the make and model of your motorcycle. The use of Parts and Accessories not designed and tested for your motorcycle may have negative consequences on the performance of your motorcycle and may create conditions not covered by the limited factory warranty. The remedy for breach of this limited Parts and Accessories warranty is expressly limited to the repair or replacement of any component that proves to be defective, and does not extend or create liability for consequential damages, costs or expenses, including loss of time, inconvenience, or loss of use of the motorcycle. Any implied warranty, including warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, is expressly limited to the duration of this limited one-year Parts and Accessories warranty, or to the shortest duration permitted by the laws in your state. EXCLUDED COMPONENTS:
All Genuine Motor Parts & Accessories will qualify for the one-year over-the-counter warranty, with the following exceptions: · Tires · Chemicals · Premium Luggage (two years) · Audio and Navigation (two years where applicable) · Non-street legal components (including Screamin' Eagle® Pro) · Anything with a manufacturer/factory warranty · Other disposable and consumable items

To obtain warranty service, return the affected component(s) with proof of purchase, at your expense, within the limited warranty period to an authorized Harley-Davidson® dealer.

Harley-Davidson Parts and Accessories Division, a facility of HarleyDavidson Motor Company, is registered to International Quality Standard ISO 9001:2008. The sale or use of these parts or accessories does not grant the purchaser a license or other right under any Harley-Davidson patent.
