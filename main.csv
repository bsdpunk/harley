COOLFLOWTM FAN Keep your cool on a sweltering summer day. Engineered to maximize rider and passenger comfort in high temperature situations, the CoolFlowTM Fan is the perfect addition if your bike is subjected to parade duty, rush hour traffic, or extreme temperature environments. Unlike traditional fan kits that try to cool the engine by blowing air across the cylinders and often onto your legs, the CoolFlow Fan Kit keeps the riders comfortable by pulling air away from the rear cylinder and exhaust pipe, and directing it toward the ground. The fan suction generates a low pressure region near the riders to balance the natural up and out convection air flow in the area behind the engine. The wind-tunnel tested fan is tucked away above the transmission, and when combined with midframe air deflectors, significantly drops the temperature the seated rider experiences. The CoolFlow Fan features switched On/Off/Auto operation. In the ON mode, the fan is active at low speeds, and will turn off when the bike reaches 40mph. As speed drops, the fan turns back on at 35mph. This logic program prevents the fan from cycling on and off during low speed changes. In the AUTO setting, the fan operates based on a combination of speed parameters and specific engine and ambient temperatures. Built to withstand the harsh motorcycle environment, the all-weather CoolFlow Fan is 100% waterproof and includes everything you need for installation. The plug-and-play design is integrated with the vehicle electronics, so On/Off/Auto fan operation is indicated in the odometer screen.

Engineered to maximize rider and passenger comfort in high temperature situations, the CoolFlowTM Fan is the perfect addition if your bike is subjected to parade duty, rush hour traffic, or extreme temperature environments. Unlike traditional fan kits that try to cool the engine by blowing air across the cylinders and often onto your legs, the CoolFlow Fan Kit keeps the riders comfortable by pulling air away from the rear cylinder and exhaust pipe, and directing it toward the ground. The fan suction generates a low pressure region near the riders to balance the natural up and out convection air flow in the area behind the engine. The wind-tunnel tested fan is tucked away above the transmission, and when combined with midframe air deflectors, significantly drops the temperature the seated rider experiences. The CoolFlow Fan features switched On/Off/Auto operation. In the ON mode, the fan is active at low speeds, and will turn off when the bike reaches 40mph. As speed drops, the fan turns back on at 35mph. This logic program prevents the fan from cycling on and off during low speed changes. In the AUTO setting, the fan operates based on a combination of speed parameters and specific engine and ambient temperatures. Built to withstand the harsh motorcycle environment, the all-weather CoolFlow Fan is 100% waterproof and includes everything you need for installation. The plug-and-play design is integrated with the vehicle electronics, so On/Off/Auto fan operation is indicated in the odometer screen. Your dealer will enable this function in the Electronic Control Module (ECM) and you're ready to roll. C. FRONT ENGINE MOUNT STABILIZER LINK BLACK Chrome. Black. D.

Adjustability to Spark Advance, Throttle progressivity, and Volumetric Efficiency to custom tune the performance combination. 50-State U.S. EPA compliant.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE SMART TUNE PRO 2 AUTOMATIC TUNING MODULE* Smart Tune PRO works with the Screamin' Eagle Pro Street Tuner to automatically adjust your bike for the combination of performance components, climates, and vehicle load conditions you are operating in. You just install the upgraded wideband oxygen sensors in the exhaust headers, download the calibration that the Screamin' Eagle engineers have developed as a starting point, then simply drive down the road and let Smart Tune Pro do the work. Ride from the flatlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Colorado without a compromise in performance. Smart Tune PRO constantly monitors the operating parameters of your motorcycle, and automatically adjusts the bike's Electronic Control Module (ECM) to maximize performance in your current riding conditions. Smart Tune Pro utilizes wideband O2 sensors that read oxygen levels in the exhaust stream to determine the optimum air/fuel ratio your bike needs at this very moment. Smart Tune Pro analyzes the data and automatically makes real-time tuning adjustments to the ECM. Unlike the standard narrow-band O2 sensors that only provide feedback in the part-throttle cruising range, the wideband sensors can read and adjust tuning throughout the part throttle cruising and full-throttle acceleration operating range. Screamin' Eagle Smart Tune Pro was developed by the Screamin' Eagle engineering team in concert with the design of your Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It is fully factory supported, and optimized to maximize performance while maintaining drivability and engine longevity.

"-42300009", "" , "A. TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE AND FILL VALVE Simplify checking the air pressure level and filling the tires on your motorcycle. This Tire Pressure Gauge features an 18 flexible hose and 2-way air chuck with both a 45 fill port and a unique side fill port that provides easy straight-in access to hard-to-reach motorcycle valve stems. The dual-range instantread gauge measures pressures from 0-60 psi and 0-400 kPa, and is protected from impact and abrasion by a thick rubber collar. Designed to fit an air compressor with a standard 1/4 quick-disconnect coupler, this gauge allows you to check the pressure and fill the tire without removing the chuck from the tire. Just apply the chuck to the valve stem, read the pressure, and add air by depressing the comfortable trigger leaver. And for checking tire pressure on the road, you can use this tool like any standard tire gauge. B. COMPACT AIR COMPRESSOR WITH LIGHT Correct tire pressure is crucial to safe operation and long tire life, but checking the pressure, finding a gas station with a working air pump, and filling the tire is a chore that many of us ignore. The Compact Air Compressor is designed to simplify this necessary procedure. The compact, lightweight 12V pump is designed for life on the road. The all-in-one pump plugs into your bike's battery charging harness, and features a built-in 0-160 psi pressure gauge and bright LED work light. The 11 air hose and 6' fuse-protected power cord easily reach the front and rear wheels, and are stored in convenient compartments when not in use. The lightweight pump features durable, impact-resistant construction, and is small enough to fit easily in a saddlebag or strap-on luggage. Kit includes pump, valve stem extension, and nylon carrying bag. A. TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE AND FILL VALVE C. VALVE STEM EXTENSION Sometimes there's just not enough space around the tire's valve stem for the gas station air chuck and hose to reach. Brake rotors, sprockets and saddlebags get in the way and keep the air chuck from making an airtight seal. When that happens, this Valve Stem Extension provides easy access. Simply screw the extension in place on the stem, fill the tire to the proper pressure, remove the extension, and replace the valve stem cap. Then toss the extension in your saddlebag or tool roll for the next time.", "Harley Davidson", "" , , "", "Title", "Default Title", , , , , "42300009", ,,,,,"9.31","10.95"

Unlike typical orifice damping, the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads, inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel, and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive, and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop.

Easyto-reach rocker switches on the side of the seat control the built-in compressor, adding and bleeding off air with the quick push of a button to help relieve stress from the lower back, tailbone or lower extremities. On a long run, occasionally inflating and deflating the air bladders reduces the numb butt effect by improving the blood flow to the extremities. So grab a seat. And enjoy the ride. A.

SUPER REACH SOLO SEAT Get a little bit closer. Super Reach forward position seats are designed to move riders with a shorter inseam even closer to the controls and to bring the legs closer together so that your feet rest firmly on the pavement. After hundreds of hours of on-road and ergonomic testing, the seat shape and foam density were selected as the ideal position for riders 5'-0 to 5'-4 tall. The Super Reach Seat moves the rider 1.5 closer to the controls compared to stock seat on XL883L model, and 2 closer and .5 lower compared to stock seat on XL1200C model. The nose is 1.0 narrower than the stock seat, and it is tastefully sculpted to look great with any size Sportster fuel tank. The combination of premium textured and smooth vinyl surfaces and charcoal gray stitching and embroidered Bar & Shield logo really set the seat apart. For the ultimate solo touring setup, add the Quick Release Rider Backrest P/N 52300245. B.

The seat shape and foam density were carefully selected after hundreds of hours of real world testing, and are ideal for riders 5'-9 to 6'-2 tall. The seat features a tapered tail to minimize the profile, and it is crafted with premium vinyl surfaces for durability. Seating -- Comfort & Touring D.

This pump was designed to allow safe and simple adjustment of the front and rear air suspension on Touring motorcycles.

H-D SMART SECURITY SYSTEM '07-LATER MODELS The H-D Smart Security System offers automatic self-arming and hands-free disarming for vehicle electronic security functions for your '07-later Harley motorcycle. The Hands-Free Fob communicates directly on its own unique and individualized frequency with the Hands-Free Security Module and Antenna. Attach the Hands-Free Fob to your vehicle ignition key ring. As you upright your vehicle or switch the ignition on, the Hands-Free Fob will communicate the Security System disarm command allowing you to start your vehicle. After riding your vehicle, park and switch the ignition off with your key. Within 5 seconds the Security System will automatically self-arm, disabling your vehicle starter, ignition and electronic fuel injection (EFI). The Smart Security System includes: Hands-Free Security Module (Integrated Security Sensor and Turn Signal Module or Body Control Module), 2 Hands-Free Fobs, Antenna Module, Antenna Harness and Antenna Mount (Dyna models). Also available: H-D SMART SECURITY SYSTEM HANDS-FREE FOB Replacement/Additional Hands-Free Fob. B.

When armed, the Security System disables the starter and ignition while monitoring the electrical system and vehicle motion with adjustable sensitivity. Minor disturbances trigger a momentary warning; major ones, an unbroken thirty-second alarm, after which the Security System returns to monitoring. A distinctive four-way flasher pattern is the alarm signal. An optional self-powered Smart Siren Kit adds a piercing scream that sounds even if the battery cable is cut. The Security System is armed and disarmed with a remote control waterproof key fob utilizing state-of-the-art rolling code technology. If the key fob is not available, the rider may arm or disarm the system by keying a previously entered personal code on the turn signal switches. Kit includes 1 Key Fob.

The Harley-Davidson DetachablesTM Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbulence behind the windscreen. When open, the controlled airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and around the rider. The revised flow reduces helmet bobbing and neck fatigue so you can comfortably spend more time in the saddle. The open vent also provides cooling airflow to the rider at low speeds and in city traffic. Engineered to provide the riding comfort of a larger windshield, this low-profile screen's contemporary contour sets it apart from the crowd. The shape keeps the windshield below your siteline so you don't look through bugs and road grime and the detachable design means you can ride without the shield when the mood strikes. The shield is formed of hard-coated polycarbonate for strength and scratch resistance and the dark-smoked finish reduces glare.

TOURING Seating -- Road Zeppelin The open road. That's where we developed and tested the revolutionary comfort of the Road Zeppelin Seat.

Easyto-reach rocker switches on the side of the seat control the built-in compressor, adding and bleeding off air with the quick push of a button to help relieve stress from the lower back, tailbone or lower extremities. On a long run, occasionally inflating and deflating the air bladders reduces the numb butt effect by improving the blood flow to the extremities. So grab a seat. And enjoy the ride. A.

SCREAMIN' EAGLE SMART TUNE PRO 2 AUTOMATIC TUNING MODULE* Smart Tune PRO works with the Screamin' Eagle Pro Street Tuner to automatically adjust your bike for the combination of performance components, climates, and vehicle load conditions you are operating in. You just install the upgraded wideband oxygen sensors in the exhaust headers, download the calibration that the Screamin' Eagle engineers have developed as a starting point, then simply drive down the road and let Smart Tune Pro do the work. Ride from the flatlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Colorado without a compromise in performance. Smart Tune PRO constantly monitors the operating parameters of your motorcycle, and automatically adjusts the bike's Electronic Control Module (ECM) to maximize performance in your current riding conditions. Smart Tune Pro utilizes wideband O2 sensors that read oxygen levels in the exhaust stream to determine the optimum air/fuel ratio your bike needs at this very moment. Smart Tune Pro analyzes the data and automatically makes real-time tuning adjustments to the ECM. Unlike the standard narrow-band O2 sensors that only provide feedback in the part-throttle cruising range, the wideband sensors can read and adjust tuning throughout the part throttle cruising and full-throttle acceleration operating range. Screamin' Eagle Smart Tune Pro was developed by the Screamin' Eagle engineering team in concert with the design of your Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It is fully factory supported, and optimized to maximize performance while maintaining drivability and engine longevity. Smart Tune PRO is 50-state EPA compliant* and does not impact the H-D factory warranty.

Big and bold is the best way to describe the musical performance you will experience when listening to your favorite band through a Boom!TM Audio Stage II sound system. The weather-proof 3-way speakers feature high-excursion woofers for extended bass performance, and separate mid- and high-frequency drivers for rich vocals and startlingly real treble notes. Powered by a dedicated 300 watt RMS amplifier, each pair of speakers is capable of producing filling-rattling volume. Designed to work seamlessly with the factory installed Boom! Audio infotainment head unit, the Boom! Stage II components are system matched and feature custom tuned static and dynamic equalization that dial in the ideal setup for your ride. And you can choose how far you want to go. From a single pair of fairing mounted speakers and a 300 watt amp to a full bore 8 speaker, 4 amp, 1200 watt system, we've got you covered. A. BOOM! AUDIO AMPLIFIER KIT Take your music to the streets. Boom!TM Audio Amplifier Kits allow you to crank up the volume with significantly less distortion. The amplifier provides more power than Original Equipment radio alone, resulting in increased volume, fuller sound reproduction, reduced clipping and lower Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Unlike aftermarket amplifiers that connect between the radio and the speakers, the Boom! Audio amplifier bypasses the radio's internal power amp to produce the cleanest sound possible. The Boom! Audio Amplifier boosts the pure source signal, minimizing any distortion generated through the speaker output. The system-matched high-output signal features optimized sound equalization for crisp, clear vocals and maximum bass response and the strong midrange response cuts through wind and road noise. The waterproof 4-channel, 75-watts RMS/channel amplifier (300-watt RMS total) has been designed from the groundup for the harsh motorcycle environment. Fairing Mounted kit includes all mounting hardware and wiring harness. Note: The use of the Boom! Audio Amplifier turns off the radio's internal amplifier. 76000278 Fairing Mounted. $599.95 Fits '14-later Electra Glide, Street Glide, Ultra Limited and Tri Glide models equipped with a Boom!

When powered by separate dedicated bass and high-frequency amplifier channels, you get double the power to each speaker (when compared to a Boom!TM Audio Stage I system) for higher volume and lower distortion.
