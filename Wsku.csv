The Billet Cam Support Plate is manufactured from billet aluminum with pressed-in bronze bushings and is pre-assembled with the crankshaft bushing and oil pressure relief valve. Aluminum is specified at 6061 billet plate heat-treated to T6 specifications with a surface-hardened anodized finish to provide superior strength rigidity and durability. CNC-precision machining ensures precise dimensions and constant material thickness across the plate enabling perfect alignment of cams and chains. Cam bushings are made from 660 bronze materials to provide enhanced wear resistance and to stand up to increased loads from the high lift cams common in large displacement motors. The improved Screamin' Eagle highflow oil pump provides higher pressure when the oil is hot to keep pressure drops to a minimum and increases the oil supply by 16% and the scavenging by 29% over the '06-'17 Original Equipment oil pump. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT This kit updates the cam chain tensioner of your Twin Cam 88 engine to the latest design as featured on the Twin Cam 96TM engine. The billet cam support plate has been designed to allow the installation of the Twin Cam 96 hydraulic cam chain tensioner to Twin Cam 88-equipped models. These Hydraulic Cam Chain Tensioners will significantly outlast the spring loaded tensioners and are an ideal addition to an engine modified for improved performance. In addition '02-'06 models utilize a Twin Cam 96 single row front roller chain and sprocket (included in kit). '99-'01 models use Original Equipment front silent chain and sprocket to retain the cam position sensor function. The kit includes an improved Screamin' Eagle HighFlow Oil Pump that provides increased oil pressure at highoperating temperatures. This kit increases the oil supply by 23% and scavenging by 50% when compared to the '99-'05 Original Equipment oil pump and reduces operating temperature of bearings to improve bearing life., Harley Davidson,  , , , Title, Default Title, , , , , 25284-11, ,,,,,424.96,499.95

SCREAMIN' EAGLE PERFORMANCE 2 SLIPPER CLUTCH FOR VRSCTM MODELS This clutch offers reduced lever effort and improved performance. The unique slip and assist ramp system opens the two halves of the clutch hub slightly during high loads to the drivetrain allowing a moderate slip that reduces shock to the drivetrain during rapid downshifting. The resulting reduction in wheel hop allows maximum contact between the tire and the road in wet or slippery conditions. Clutch lever effort is also reduced by 20% in 1130cc and 30% on 1250cc applications., Harley Davidson,  , , , Title, Default Title, , , , , 37938-08, ,,,,,203.96,239.95

reach-seats-50932-08, REACH SEATS  , SOFTAIL Seating Reach & Tallboy Designed to position riders with a shorter inseam closer to the ground Reach Seats are shaped to place the rider in a comfortable and confident relationship to the hand and foot controls. The wide seating surface provides loads of support while riding and the narrow tapered nose brings your legs together for an easier reach to the ground at a stop. Reach Seats feature a stepped profile that provides back support and keeps the rider from sliding back during acceleration. A. REACH SEAT Designed specifically for riders requiring a close to the bar riding position this seat positions the rider approximately 1.0 forward and the narrow front profile brings your legs closer together to help you plant your feet firmly on the ground. The seat features a textured vinyl insert and a Bar & Shield logo that shows you are riding in style. REACH SEAT REACH SEAT BLACKLINETM & SOFTAIL SLIM The Reach forward position seat is designed to move riders 1.25 closer to the hand and foot controls.

The correct riding position can help a tall rider sit comfortably on the bike and avoid leg cramps and back strain during a long day in the saddle. For riders with a longer inseam a Tallboy Seat will put you on the road to fatigue-free riding.

Tallboy Seats feature a bucket-shaped design for added support and a wide seating surface to reduce pressure on the tailbone. This Tallboy Seat moves the rider back 2.0 and up 3.0 as compared to the Original Equipment seat.

Seating Low Profile When it's time to go it alone go in style. These premium quality cowhide leather solo saddles feature a smooth sleek design that hugs the frame rails for a true custom look.

The top-grain leather seating surface and contoured foam padding provide a firm but luxurious feel. Seat does not fit with passenger pillions. BRAWLER SOLO SEAT The traditional Badlander seat's low and lean style sets the stage for your minimalist custom ride. The frame-hugging rider seat and the slim tapered passenger pillion visually stretch the bike and enhance the slammed look. The seat shape stays low along its entire length and follows the lines of the bike with minimal disruption and delivers a riding position that is lower and generally further back than the stock seat. Ideal for both short riders needing to be closer to the ground or for tall riders that want to move back in the bike without sitting higher.

The frame-hugging rider seat and the slim tapered passenger pillion visually stretch the bike and enhance the slammed look. The seat shape stays low along its entire length and follows the lines of the bike with minimal disruption and delivers a riding position that is lower and generally further back than the stock seat. Ideal for both short riders needing to be closer to the ground or for tall riders that want to move back in the bike without sitting higher. This seat is wrapped in supple top-grain leather and finished with an embroidered Harley-Davidson script. Kit includes leather grab strap and mounting hardware. LEATHER BADLANDER SEAT NOTE: Some Harley-Davidson seats are made of leather. Fine leathers or other natural materials WILL gain character such as wrinkles or wear with age. This is normal. A fine aged patina and character wrinkles are a sign of the extremely high quality materials used to construct your seat or backrest. The appearance of scars or marks on the leather are a result of using natural leather panels and should not be thought of as an imperfection. Please use Harley-Davidson Leather Protectant P/N 93600034 to protect your investment.

HA N DLE BAR DI M E N S IONS Handlebars Batwing Just about every model of Harley-Davidson motorcycle features a different stock handlebar. Selected to complement the style or use of the bike the handlebar may be the ideal shape for many riders but of course not everyone has the same physical characteristics. Choosing a bar for your batwing fairing-equipped model is about more than just style it's about how you approach the road. Where the bar positions your hands wrists and arms directly affects how you feel on your motorcycle. For every set of bars there are three factors at work: rise pullback and width. These three measurements determine your reach to the hand controls and therefore your overall feeling of comfort and control.

touring-58163-02, TOURING , Windshields -- Road King Reduce helmet buffeting at speed. The Harley-Davidson DetachablesTM Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbulence behind the windscreen. When open the controlled airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and around the rider.

TOURING Windshields -- Road King Reduce helmet buffeting at speed. The Harley-Davidson DetachablesTM Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbulence behind the windscreen. When open the controlled airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and around the rider. The revised flow reduces helmet bobbing and neck fatigue so you can comfortably spend more time in the saddle. The open vent also provides cooling airflow to the rider at low speeds and in city traffic. Engineered to provide the riding comfort of a larger windshield this low-profile screen's contemporary contour sets it apart from the crowd. The shape keeps the windshield below your site line so you don't look through bugs and road grime and the detachable design means you can ride without the shield when the mood strikes. The shield is formed of hard-coated polycarbonate for strength and scratch resistance and the dark-smoked finish reduces glare. The slim polished stainless steel brackets mount to the Original Equipment rubber isolated docking points for ease of installation and removal.

The Harley-Davidson DetachablesTM Wind Splitter Vented Windshield features an exclusive fingertip-adjustable center vent that reduces turbulence behind the windscreen. When open the controlled airflow fills the negative pressure area behind the shield and helps to smooth the flow of air over the top of the screen and around the rider. The revised flow reduces helmet bobbing and neck fatigue so you can comfortably spend more time in the saddle. The open vent also provides cooling airflow to the rider at low speeds and in city traffic. Engineered to provide the riding comfort of a larger windshield this low-profile screen's contemporary contour sets it apart from the crowd. The shape keeps the windshield below your siteline so you don't look through bugs and road grime and the detachable design means you can ride without the shield when the mood strikes. The shield is formed of hard-coated polycarbonate for strength and scratch resistance and the dark-smoked finish reduces glare. The slim polished stainless steel brackets mount to the Original Equipment rubber isolated docking points for ease of installation and removal.

The 10-quart capacity pan will capture 2 engine oil changes or the complete drain fluids (engine oil primary and transmission) from any H-D Powertrain including Milwaukee-Eight and Twin Cam motorcycle. The Drain Pan is large enough to catch the oil from the entire length of the primary and is sized to hold and drain an inverted primary cover. The Drain Pan features a raised hardware corral a filter drain surface and a pressure vent hole to prevent messy oil burping. The drained waste oil is sealed safely inside the pan with high-quality gasketed caps and plugs. Convenient carrying handle simplifies transport to an approved waste oil facility. 63795-10 10-Quart Capacity. $30.95, Harley Davidson,  , , , Title, Default Title, , , , , 63795-10, ,,,,,26.31,30.95

AUDIO & GAUGES Fairing Lower Boom!TM Audio Stage II BOOM!TM AUDIO STAGE II COMPONENTS* Headline your own concert tour. Big and bold is the best way to describe the musical performance you will experience when listening to your favorite band through a Boom!TM Audio Stage II sound system. The weather-proof 3-way speakers feature high-excursion woofers for extended bass performance and separate mid- and high-frequency drivers for rich vocals and startlingly real treble notes. Powered by a dedicated 300 watt RMS amplifier each pair of speakers is capable of producing filling-rattling volume. Designed to work seamlessly with the factory installed Boom! Audio infotainment head unit the Boom! Stage II components are system matched and feature custom tuned static and dynamic equalization that dial in the ideal setup for your ride. And you can choose how far you want to go. From a single pair of fairing mounted speakers and a 300 watt amp to a full bore 8 speaker 4 amp 1200 watt system we've got you covered. A. BOOM! AUDIO AMPLIFIER KIT Take your music to the streets. Boom!TM Audio Amplifier Kits allow you to crank up the volume with significantly less distortion. The amplifier provides more power than Original Equipment radio alone resulting in increased volume fuller sound reproduction reduced clipping and lower Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). Unlike aftermarket amplifiers that connect between the radio and the speakers the Boom! Audio amplifier bypasses the radio's internal power amp to produce the cleanest sound possible. The Boom! Audio Amplifier boosts the pure source signal minimizing any distortion generated through the speaker output. The system-matched high-output signal features optimized sound equalization for crisp clear vocals and maximum bass response and the strong midrange response cuts through wind and road noise. The waterproof 4-channel 75-watts RMS/channel amplifier (300-watt RMS total) has been designed from the groundup for the harsh motorcycle environment. Fairing Mounted kit includes all mounting hardware and wiring harness. Note: The use of the Boom! Audio Amplifier turns off the radio's internal amplifier. 76000278 Fairing Mounted. $599.95 Fits '14-later Electra Glide Street Glide Ultra Limited and Tri Glide models equipped with a Boom!
