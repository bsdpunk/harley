A high-lift version of the SE-211 camshaft, this cam works great with 103 cubic inch and larger engines with free-flowing intake and exhaust. It can be used with stock heads (updated with race springs) and high-compression pistons for even more torque than a SE-211 cam or can be coupled with any of the performance heads to realize the full power potential. 50-State U.S. EPA compliant. SE-585 CAM KIT This cam is a great match for riders of heavy Touring bikes looking for big torque at the low end. Just a quick downshift to fourth gear results in an effortless pass of that slow moving tractor-trailer ahead of you. This cam provides an early hit of torque at the low end of the RPM spectrum. A unique combination of lift, cam lobe duration and an enhanced cam profile ramp provides a performance boost you can feel.
