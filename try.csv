The Billet Cam Support Plate is manufactured from billet aluminum with pressed-in bronze bushings and is pre-assembled with the crankshaft bushing and oil pressure relief valve. Aluminum is specified at 6061 billet plate, heat-treated to T6 specifications with a surface-hardened anodized finish to provide superior strength, rigidity and durability. CNC-precision machining ensures precise dimensions and constant material thickness across the plate, enabling perfect alignment of cams and chains. Cam bushings are made from 660 bronze materials to provide enhanced wear resistance and to stand up to increased loads from the high lift cams common in large displacement motors. The improved Screamin' Eagle highflow oil pump provides higher pressure when the oil is hot to keep pressure drops to a minimum and increases the oil supply by 16% and the scavenging by 29% over the '06-'17 Original Equipment oil pump. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT This kit updates the cam chain tensioner of your Twin Cam 88 engine to the latest design, as featured on the Twin Cam 96TM engine. The billet cam support plate has been designed to allow the installation of the Twin Cam 96 hydraulic cam chain tensioner to Twin Cam 88-equipped models. These Hydraulic Cam Chain Tensioners will significantly outlast the spring loaded tensioners and are an ideal addition to an engine modified for improved performance. In addition, '02-'06 models utilize a Twin Cam 96 single row front roller chain and sprocket (included in kit). '99-'01 models use Original Equipment front silent chain and sprocket to retain the cam position sensor function. The kit includes an improved Screamin' Eagle HighFlow Oil Pump that provides increased oil pressure at highoperating temperatures. This kit increases the oil supply by 23% and scavenging by 50% when compared to the '99-'05 Original Equipment oil pump and reduces operating temperature of bearings to improve bearing life.", "Harley Davidson", "" , , "", "Title", "Default Title", , , , , "17045-99D", ,,,,,"365.46","429.95"

Requires separate purchase of Cam Drive Retention Kit P/N 25566-06. Installation may require Cam Spacer Kit P/N 25928-06. All models require ECM calibration with Screamin' Eagle Pro Street Tuner for proper installation. SCREAMIN' EAGLE SE8-447 CAM TORQUE Enhanced torque in the low to mid RPM band Ideal for a fully-loaded bike Increased horsepower in the mid RPM range Responds well to roll-on throttle application Crisp throttle response and acceleration at lower speeds Can be used with stock valve springs SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 STAGE II TORQUE KIT This kit was developed for the budget minded rider that wants to experience crisp throttle response and acceleration they can feel at slower speeds. The 5% increase in torque can be felt immediately off the line and continues to build by up to a 14% increase @ 4500 RPM the ideal power band for passing slow moving vehicles. SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 STAGE II POWER KIT This kit was developed for the budget minded rider that wants to experience that adrenaline-pumping burst of speed while heading toward the red line. The additional power starts to build @ 3000 RPM and continues to build by up to 24% at redline. Riding the bike aggressively will require downshifting to lower gears to keep the engine operating in the higher RPM range. SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 ENGINE STAGE III KIT This kit was developed for the rider looking for a solid seat of the pants increase you can feel every time you roll on the throttle. The increase in displacement and the bump in compression deliver a significant increase in torque and power over stock while restoring the sensation of riding solo when taking that long trip with a passenger and luggage. The Stage III 107 to 114 upgrade delivers up to 39% more power, and the 114 to 117 upgrade increases power by up to 24% when compared to the Original Equipment engine configurations. The increased compression and cam upgrade will also deliver 17% improvement over a stock CVO117 configuration. SCREAMIN' EAGLE MILWAUKEE-EIGHT 2 ENGINE STAGE IV KIT This Stage IV Kit was developed to deliver maximum horsepower from the Milwaukee-Eight engine - all the way to the redline. The system-matched combination of larger displacement cylinders, free flowing CNC-Ported cylinder heads and a cam with the highest available valve lift are the starting point to building the perfect engine for the performance junkie. The addition of the large 64mm bore throttle body and high-flow injectors provides great acceleration from first gear through sixth and exceptional response at the twist of the throttle. Designed for a high level of flexibility, this package is ideal for riders who want stump pulling torque throughout the RPM range and also crave plenty of arm-pulling acceleration when you whack the throttle. The Stage IV 107 to 114 upgrade delivers up to 52% more power, and the 114 to 117 upgrade increases power by up to 40% when compared to the Original Equipment engine configurations. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE 2 WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP A great upgrade for any performance motor. The Billet Cam Support Plate is manufactured from billet aluminum with pressed-in bronze bushings and is pre-assembled with the crankshaft bushing and oil pressure relief valve. Aluminum is specified at 6061 billet plate, heat-treated to T6 specifications with a surface-hardened anodized finish to provide superior strength, rigidity and durability. CNC-precision machining ensures precise dimensions and constant material thickness across the plate, enabling perfect alignment of cams and chains. Cam bushings are made from 660 bronze materials to provide enhanced wear resistance and to stand up to increased loads from the high lift cams common in large displacement motors. The improved Screamin' Eagle highflow oil pump provides higher pressure when the oil is hot to keep pressure drops to a minimum and increases the oil supply by 16% and the scavenging by 29% over the '06-'17 Original Equipment oil pump. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BILLET CAM SUPPORT PLATE WITH HIGH-VOLUME OIL PUMP SCREAMIN' EAGLE HYDRAULIC 2 CAM CHAIN TENSIONER AND HIGH-FLOW OIL PUMP UPGRADE KIT This kit updates the cam chain tensioner of your Twin Cam 88 engine to the latest design, as featured on the Twin Cam 96TM engine. The billet cam support plate has been designed to allow the installation of the Twin Cam 96 hydraulic cam chain tensioner to Twin Cam 88-equipped models. These Hydraulic Cam Chain Tensioners will significantly outlast the spring loaded tensioners and are an ideal addition to an engine modified for improved performance. In addition, '02-'06 models utilize a Twin Cam 96 single row front roller chain and sprocket (included in kit). '99-'01 models use Original Equipment front silent chain and sprocket to retain the cam position sensor function. The kit includes an improved Screamin' Eagle HighFlow Oil Pump that provides increased oil pressure at highoperating temperatures. This kit increases the oil supply by 23% and scavenging by 50% when compared to the '99-'05 Original Equipment oil pump and reduces operating temperature of bearings to improve bearing life.", "Harley Davidson", "" , , "", "Title", "Default Title", , , , , "25566-06", ,,,,,"161.46","189.95"

The surface area is increased by 13% and the spring rate is increased by 10% for a combination that can handle over 115 ft-lbs of torque at the crank, a 23% increase over the stock-rated capacity. Kit includes Kevlar fiber-based friction discs and performance clutch spring. SCREAMIN' EAGLE PERFORMANCE 2 SLIPPER CLUTCH FOR VRSCTM MODELS This clutch offers reduced lever effort and improved performance. The unique slip and assist ramp system opens the two halves of the clutch hub slightly during high loads to the drivetrain, allowing a moderate slip that reduces shock to the drivetrain during rapid downshifting. The resulting reduction in wheel hop allows maximum contact between the tire and the road in wet or slippery conditions. Clutch lever effort is also reduced by 20% in 1130cc and 30% on 1250cc applications.", "Harley Davidson", "" , , "", "Title", "Default Title", , , , , "37938-08K", ,,,,,"203.96","239.95"
"-37951-98", "" , "SCREAMIN' EAGLE BIG TWIN 2 COMPENSATOR This premium compensator has been engineered with heavier springs and increased travel to support the high torque output associated with high compression race and large displacement engines. Designed to outperform the Original Equipment compensator, this unit helps protect the engine and driveline components during harsh drag race launches. Compensator features improved oil passages, oil deflectors and a needle bearing thrust washer that improves the overall operation of these components. SCREAMIN' EAGLE BIG TWIN COMPENSATOR SCREAMIN' EAGLE VARIABLE PRESSURE CLUTCH 2 Get more performance from the Original Equipment clutch. The Screamin' Eagle Variable Pressure Clutch is designed to help put the added power from a Screamin' Eagle Stage Kit to the pavement. This bolt-on kit harnesses the centrifugal force of spinning weights to increase the clutch capacity as engine speed increases. The mechanism applies increasing pressure to the stock clutch pressure plate as RPM rises. The result: High torque-handling capabilities without increasing clutch lever effort at idle. The Variable Pressure Clutch also provides smoother clutch disengagement at lower speed. Kit fits behind most stock derby covers with no modifications. See installation manual for additional accessory derby cover fitment information.
