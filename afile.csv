Engineered to maximize rider and passenger comfort in high temperature situations, the CoolFlowTM Fan is the perfect addition if your bike is subjected to parade duty, rush hour traffic, or extreme temperature environments. Unlike traditional fan kits that try to cool the engine by blowing air across the cylinders and often onto your legs, the CoolFlow Fan Kit keeps the riders comfortable by pulling air away from the rear cylinder and exhaust pipe, and directing it toward the ground. The fan suction generates a low pressure region near the riders to balance the natural up and out convection air flow in the area behind the engine. The wind-tunnel tested fan is tucked away above the transmission, and when combined with midframe air deflectors, significantly drops the temperature the seated rider experiences.

Ride from the flatlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Colorado without a compromise in performance. Smart Tune PRO constantly monitors the operating parameters of your motorcycle, and automatically adjusts the bike's Electronic Control Module (ECM) to maximize performance in your current riding conditions. Smart Tune Pro utilizes wideband O2 sensors that read oxygen levels in the exhaust stream to determine the optimum air/fuel ratio your bike needs at this very moment. Smart Tune Pro analyzes the data and automatically makes real-time tuning adjustments to the ECM. Unlike the standard narrow-band O2 sensors that only provide feedback in the part-throttle cruising range, the wideband sensors can read and adjust tuning throughout the part throttle cruising and full-throttle acceleration operating range. Screamin' Eagle Smart Tune Pro was developed by the Screamin' Eagle engineering team in concert with the design of your Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It is fully factory supported, and optimized to maximize performance while maintaining drivability and engine longevity.

"tire-pressure-gauge-and-42300009", "TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE AND" , "Simplify checking the air pressure level and filling the tires on your motorcycle. This Tire Pressure Gauge features an 18 flexible hose and 2-way air chuck with both a 45 fill port and a unique side fill port that provides easy straight-in access to hard-to-reach motorcycle valve stems. The dual-range instantread gauge measures pressures from 0-60 psi and 0-400 kPa, and is protected from impact and abrasion by a thick rubber collar. Designed to fit an air compressor with a standard 1/4 quick-disconnect coupler, this gauge allows you to check the pressure and fill the tire without removing the chuck from the tire. Just apply the chuck to the valve stem, read the pressure, and add air by depressing the comfortable trigger leaver. And for checking tire pressure on the road, you can use this tool like any standard tire gauge. Correct tire pressure is crucial to safe operation and long tire life, but checking the pressure, finding a gas station with a working air pump, and filling the tire is a chore that many of us ignore. The Compact Air Compressor is designed to simplify this necessary procedure. The compact, lightweight 12V pump is designed for life on the road. The all-in-one pump plugs into your bike's battery charging harness, and features a built-in 0-160 psi pressure gauge and bright LED work light. The 11 air hose and 6' fuse-protected power cord easily reach the front and rear wheels, and are stored in convenient compartments when not in use. The lightweight pump features durable, impact-resistant construction, and is small enough to fit easily in a saddlebag or strap-on luggage. Kit includes pump, valve stem extension, and nylon carrying bag. TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE AND FILL VALVE Sometimes there's just not enough space around the tire's valve stem for the gas station air chuck and hose to reach. Brake rotors, sprockets and saddlebags get in the way and keep the air chuck from making an airtight seal. When that happens, this Valve Stem Extension provides easy access. Simply screw the extension in place on the stem, fill the tire to the proper pressure, remove the extension, and replace the valve stem cap. Then toss the extension in your saddlebag or tool roll for the next time.", "Harley Davidson", "" , "Tags", "true", "Title", "Default Title", , , , , "42300009", ,
