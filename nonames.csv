You just install the upgraded wideband oxygen sensors in the exhaust headers, download the calibration that the Screamin' Eagle engineers have developed as a starting point, then simply drive down the road and let Smart Tune Pro do the work. Ride from the flatlands of South Dakota to the mountains of Colorado without a compromise in performance. Smart Tune PRO constantly monitors the operating parameters of your motorcycle, and automatically adjusts the bike's Electronic Control Module (ECM) to maximize performance in your current riding conditions. Smart Tune Pro utilizes wideband O2 sensors that read oxygen levels in the exhaust stream to determine the optimum air/fuel ratio your bike needs at this very moment. Smart Tune Pro analyzes the data and automatically makes real-time tuning adjustments to the ECM. Unlike the standard narrow-band O2 sensors that only provide feedback in the part-throttle cruising range, the wideband sensors can read and adjust tuning throughout the part throttle cruising and full-throttle acceleration operating range. Screamin' Eagle Smart Tune Pro was developed by the Screamin' Eagle engineering team in concert with the design of your Harley-Davidson motorcycle. It is fully factory supported, and optimized to maximize performance while maintaining drivability and engine longevity. Smart Tune PRO is 50-state EPA compliant* and does not impact the H-D factory warranty.

Original Equipment on many Touring models, these Color-Matched Fairing Lowers feature a venting system that allows you to adjust the amount of air that circulates across the engine. On hot days, open the vent to direct additional cooling air and on cold or rainy days, close the vents for maximum protection from the elements. The ratcheting friction lock pivot allows you to easily set the position. The complete kit includes left and right Fairing Lower, convenient glove box and lid and all necessary mounting hardware.

This guard offers a slim, low-profile design that retains function while delivering a unique styling twist. The upper mounts connect midway up the downtube, 11 inches lower than the stock guard. The minimalistic look reduces the visual mass of the bike, while the mounting point lowers the bike's visual center of gravity.

Tuned to work in concert with the Premium Emulsion Rear Shocks, the fork damping is controlled by a specifically calibrated piston and valve stack. Unlike typical orifice damping, the piston/valve system helps the cartridge fork achieve a linear damping force curve for consistent feel throughout the compression and extension of the front suspension. The cartridge allows the forks to react quickly to rough roads, inspiring rider confidence in sweeping corners. The compression piston provides excellent low speed damping for a better rider feel, and the rebound spring provides a smoother feel during topping. The cartridge fork resists bottoming and dive, and the triple rate spring and oil lock allows the forks to absorb bumps even under hard braking giving the rider more control while resisting wheel hop.
