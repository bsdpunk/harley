A couple of questions, and let’s use:  QUICK-RELEASE SUPER SPORT WINDSHIELD (pg30, first product)

1. As our example, Should there be two entries, one for 18" Light Smoke. Overall height – 20"; width – 17.5".  and one for 18" Light Smoke. height – 24"; width – 17.5". ? 
If so were should the differences be listed, the description?

2. Also it looks like in tags, as you said it’s your own filter. But some are easy enough. softail18 if it fits the softail 18 model. But in our example: QUICK-RELEASE SUPER SPORT WINDSHIELD belongs to bikes ‘Fits ’15-later XG models (except XG750A). ‘ Is there a predetermined category for this, and if so, are there a list of categories.

3. In the description I currently have no html, I can change that…but, I would need to know what explicitly warrants , paragraph tags or other nicities. It looks like you have paragraph tags go where they should to break up actual paragraphs, so that’s easy enough but some phrases in the example files have span tags. I can put these in if I know what warrants a span tag.

4. Should I leave published blank, should I put fans, should I put true?
5.  I guess instead of asking for all 45 fields individually, can you give me a list of sources for the ones, that I need to fill out.
